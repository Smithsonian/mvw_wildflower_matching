"MOUNTAIN LADYSLIPPER

Cypripedium montanum Douglas

One lovely morning in early summer we left camp near Radium Hot Springs in the Columbia River Valley in British Columbia, our two saddle horses harnessed to the buckboard, the saddles securely tied behind the seat. After a drive of seven miles the horses were saddled, and we followed a disused trail four or five miles back into the range on the eastern side of the valley. There were many flowers, the dense growth of trees and shrubs keeping out the hot rays of the sun and conserving the moisture. Just as we turned across a partially shaded flat on the side of the little canyon we had been traversing, a wonderful sight burst upon us. Scattered among the low-growing bushes were great clumps of this splendid orchid in the perfection of bloom. A beautiful plant about eighteen inches tall, with a delicate perfume quite its own—no wonder that we quickly dismounted to pay homage to this queen of the forest.

Never before had we seen such a flower, and no book upon the plants of the Canadian Rockies mentioned its occurrence there. A bunch carried to camp survived many days, long after the sketch was completed.

The mountain ladyslipper is frequently found in the mountains of California, and northward along the coast as far as Vancouver, and northeastward along the Rocky Mountains to Saskatchewan.

"PUSSY-EARS

Calochortus elegans Lindley

We were following the old stage road, now replaced by a new motor road, in the Columbia River Valley, twenty miles south of Canal Flats, at an altitude of 2,500 feet. The marvelous larches and pines of the primeval forest towered above us, and over the grassy forest floor were scattered many flowers with which we were familiar. Suddenly we saw the grass dotted with a white lily, which was unknown to us, and upon examination we quickly comprehended the reason for its common name of “pussy-ears,” which our companion gave it. So graceful was it that we could only wonder that a flower so beautiful had not been enticed long ago to grow in our cultivated gardens.

Pussy-ears ranges from Utah and California to British Columbia and Montana.

"FALSE LOCOWEED

Oxytropis gracilis (Nelson) Jones

This plant must not be confused with its relative, the true loco-weed, that is so destructive to animals on the plains of the southwestern United States; it seemed entirely harmless to our horses, who ate it freely. In full sunshine its pale yellow or straw-colored flowers, borne on stems six or eight inches tall, are wonderfully attractive against their setting of sage-colored foliage. In limestone regions, where moisture is limited, the blossoms develop well only if an abundance of water is available at flowering time.

False locoweed is a member of the Pea Family. It ranges from Idaho to South Dakota and northward into Alberta, Canada.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Ghost River on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, twenty-five miles from Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"NODDING LADIES-TRESSES

Ibidium cernuum (Linnaeus) House

SLENDER LADIES-TRESSES

Ibidium gracile (Bigelow) House

These two fall-blooming members of the Orchid Family are frequently found growing in the grass of old pastures. Nodding ladies-tresses usually chooses a wet situation, but the slender one is more likely to be found in drier places. Both are inconspicuous in their chosen habitats, for their leaves and stalks are so grasslike that they seem a part of the general herbage. The genus name has arisen from the fancied resemblance of the anther to the head of an ibis.

Many botanists prefer to use the genus name Spiranthes, which means spital-flower, but Ibidium has priority.

Slender ladies-tresses is notable for its green-centered lip, and for the fact that its leaves, which are evergreen, wither away before flowering time, the flower stalks bearing only inconspicuous bracts.

These two orchids have a similar range, occurring from Florida northward and westward, extending into southernmost Canada.

The specimens sketched were found near Mount Kisco, New York.

"PINK FUMEROOT

Capnoides sempervirens (Linnaeus) Borkhausen

Pink fumeroot is a dainty wild beauty that loves rich rocky woods, where it grows in perfection. The leaves are a delicate shade of green, and the pale pink flowers, with a yellow lip, poised on slender stems, sway gently in the wind. The plant is a relative of the bleeding-heart of our gardens, and of the European fumitory. Like the latter, its roots exhale an intense nitrous odor, and the common name fumeroot refers to this characteristic feature.

Pink fumeroot has a wide range, from North Carolina to Nova Scotia and westward to British Columbia and Alaska.

We found it in the valley of the Kootenai River near the motor road between Banff and the Columbia River Valley, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"SUN-DIAL LUPINE

Lupinus perennis Linnaeus

Sun-dial lupine in the East seldom equals in profusion of growth its sisters of the West, which often cover the hillsides with a carpet of bloom. Nevertheless, this common species of the Eastern States is as beautiful as any of the others, and deserves a place of honor in our wild gardens. In rich loam it will dwindle and die, but if planted in an acid, sandy soil, it will thrive in cultivation. Although usually bright blue, the flowers are occasionally white or lavender, sometimes bordering on purple.

In Texas, one of the lupines commonly called blue-bonnets has been named the State flower.

The sun-dial lupine is found from Louisiana and Florida north to Maine and Minnesota.

The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"BIG WHORTLEBERRY

Vaccinium membranaceum Douglas

Snow slides are not to be desired, but after they have mowed down the forest of the mountain slopes, exposing the ground to the full sunlight, a bushy growth springs up, three or four feet tall, with young trees interspersed. Among these shrubs we find whortleberry bushes, Rocky Mountain rhododendron, and other plants that love similar conditions of soil and exposure. Here in late summer a delightful feast is spread for the traveler, for the big whortleberry bushes are loaded with dark purple berries, some of them as large as small cherries. A large quantity may be gathered in a short time. The black bears also appreciate them, and often are met in these localities, sitting on their haunches and sweeping the ripe fruit into their mouths with their great paws. In autumn the leaves turn a deep red.

Big whortleberry is found occasionally in the Rockies, but reaches greatest perfection in the Selkirk Mountains, and is especially abundant at Rogers Pass and in the vicinity of Glacier House at Glacier. It ranges from California, Wyoming, and Michigan to British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Hector Station on the Canadian Pacific Railway, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"PINEBARREN GENTIAN

Gentiana porphyrio Gmelin

Pinebarren gentian is a graceful and attractive plant. Its deep blue corolla lobes, with peculiar fringes between them, and the curious yellow markings on the inside, make a pleasing color combination seldom seen in flowers. It frequents moist pine barrens, reaching a foot or more in height, and although the flowers grow singly on the branches, a number of stems usually arise from each root, so that the clumps are very showy.

This gentian blooms from late August into October, and can be cultivated if given the moist, acid, peaty soil in which it thrives in the wild state. It occurs in the Coastal Plain from Florida to southern New Jersey.

The specimen sketched was found near Wilmington, North Carolina.

"SKELETON FLOWER

Lygodesmia juncea (Pursh) Don

This is a strange-looking plant, a foot tall, with pale pink, starlike flowers that close in the afternoon, or very soon after being gathered. Unconsciously, the observer is likely to notice only the flowers, for the rushlike stems and scalelike foliage are sage-green and inconspicuous. The plant belongs to the subdivision of the Aster Family that includes the dandelion, wild lettuce, and hawkweed, and is characterized by having all the flowers of the head furnished with petallike rays, and by a bitter milky juice.

The skeletonflower is found from Nevada and New Mexico north to Minnesota and Alberta.

We found it growing on a dry bank, high above the Kootenai River, near the junction of this stream with the Columbia River in British Columbia, at an altitude of 2,800 feet, and marveled that it could thrive in dusty soil, which remains damp only a short time after the mountain showers cease.

"LAKE LOUISE ARNICA

Arnica louiseana Fatr

The horses had traveled a hard and stony way, very steep in places, for we were riding above timber line to visit an alpine lake tucked away in a glaciated cirque near the headwaters of the Clearwater River in British Columbia. There had been no trail to follow, except for the first half mile from camp, and we had reveled in the constant succession of wild gardens, filled with mountain flowers in the perfection of bloom, through which we were passing. Many of the plants were crushed by the feet of the ponies, and we were continually on the watch for new varieties. A long grassy slope facing north was being conquered, when several yellow flowers appeared, quite different from any we had seen before in the mountains. Upon closer examination they were recognized as the rare Lake Louise arnica, a composite found only in the Canadian Rockies. The best specimens were carefully gathered, carried to camp, and sketched without delay, but the thrill of seeing them in their native habitat will always be recalled with delight.

"RED LILIES

Lilium montanum Nelson

Such hosts of red lilies are seen in the dry woods of the Canadian Rockies in some sections in July, that the prodigality of nature seems astounding. If perchance a richer soil and more sunlight are available, the perfectly developed flowers and the stouter leaves and stems indicate an appreciation of these favors. But the red lilies are tender things, withering speedily when gathered, especially when exposed to sun and wind, and they do not easily revive when placed in water.

The red lily is found in the Rocky Mountains from New Mexico to British Columbia, and eastward in the foothills and valleys.

The specimen painted was gathered in Sinclair Canyon, not far from Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.

"COTTONGRASS

Eriophorum chamissonis Meyer

In all parts of the Rocky Mountains of Canada one’s attention is drawn in mid-July to the masses of sedge growing along the wet borders of alpine lakes, oftentimes out of the water itself. If there have been a few dry days, the cottony heads are waving in the breeze, as it fitfully blows over them. Farther away from the lake shore the plants become scattered and lose much of the beauty that comes from a massed effect. Buffeted by mountain showers and winds, they are in their prime only a few days.

This species of cottongrass is found usually about timber line in the Rockies. It is a circumpolar plant, occurring in northern Europe and Asia as well as North America. On this continent, it perhaps survived the glacial period in Wyoming and adjoining States, where it still grows, but since the ice retreated it has spread far into Alaska, and eastward across Canada to Ontario and even to New Brunswick.

The sketch was made from specimens gathered at Cottongrass Lake, north of Ptarmigan Pass, ten miles north of Lake Louise Station, Alberta, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

"VERNAL IRIS

Iris verna Linnaeus

Although the vernal iris is not very well known, it is so lovely a wildling that it should find a home in our wildflower gardens. In his 
“Book of the Iris”, Dykes reports his inability to cultivate it, but this was probably owing to his failure to recognize its peculiar soil requirements. It usually grows on wooded hillsides, preferring a mediacid soil. Though the whole plant is only about six inches tall, its violet-blue flowers with yellow markings at the base of the petals cannot be easily overlooked, for they are very large in proportion to the grasslike leaves. In early spring the blossoms dot the barren fields of the Southern States, where real blue violets do not occur, and are often called “violets.” Curiously enough, their delicate fragrance adds to the deception, for it closely resembles the scent of the garden violet.

This iris ranges over most of Alabama and Georgia and the states adjoining them on the north, but farther northward it becomes rare, occurring in but a few favored localities in Kentucky, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.

The specimen painted was found near Beaufort, South Carolina.

"ANEMONELLA

Syndesmon thalictroides (Linnaeus) Hoffmannsegg

Anemonella, often called rue-anemone, frequents open woods, where it is found in company with hepatica and bloodroot when the first warm days of spring call sleeping plants to awaken. The slender stems, bearing the fragile green leaves and delicate pink or white florets, grow from a cluster of small tuberous roots. These hold so lightly to the soil that they are easily pulled up, unless care is taken in plucking the flowering stems. Anemonella, the only member of its genus, resembles somewhat its relatives, the true anemones or windflowers, but differs in having the flowers in clusters, and the leaves divided into rounded leaflets. It yields readily to cultivation and is a real desideratum for the wildflower garden.

Anemonella is a wide-ranging species, extending from Florida to New Hampshire and westward to Kansas and Minnesota.

The specimen sketched was found at Washington, District of Columbia.

"WHITE TROUTLILY

Erythronium albidum Nuttall

White troutlily is one of the daintiest of our early spring flowers, and east of the Appalachian Mountains is much rarer than the yellow species, which it closely resembles in habit. The shining green leaves are marked with pale mottlings of brownish purple, or in exceptional plants are entirely green. The flowers open only in bright sunlight, and speedily close and wither when gathered. It is known in some sections as dogtooth violet, but as it has no relation to the Violet Family, the name troutlily, suggested by John Burroughs, seems most appropriate.

White troutlily is the common species in the Middle West, from Texas to Minnesota, and eastward to the Appalachian Mountain region. Here and there its seeds have chanced to cross the mountain barrier and, carried down the streams, have lodged along the banks and established colonies in the Piedmont regions from Georgia to northern New Jersey.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the Potomac Valley above Washington, District of Columbia.

"HAZEL ALDER

Alnus rugosa (Du Roi) Sprengel

The alders are widespread shrubs known to all who welcome the coming of spring. With the exception of the skunk cabbage, their blooms are the earliest forerunners of spring, and almost every swamp and sheltered brook where the sun can penetrate is decorated with numerous bushes, hung with purple and yellow pendent catkins. The pollen, furnished by these in large quantities, is blown by the wind, lighting on the little green or purplish knobs of pistillate flowers, which grow into ripe cones in autumn. Several species of the genus Alnus contain in their bark a coloring principle of value, dyeing either yellow or orange. With copperas added, a good black may be made from it. Before the coming of the white man with his commercial colors, alder dye was frequently used by the Indians.

There are several species of alder in the United States, the one here represented ranging from Florida to Texas and from Maine to Minnesota.

The sketch was made from a specimen gathered near Washington, District of Columbia.

"TARFLOWER

Befaria racemosa Ventenat

While traveling through the South in June, whether by rail or automobile, one finds the green fringe of low shrubbery by the roadsides dotted here and there with the pink starlike blossoms of the tarflower. These shrubs rarely occur in dense vegetation, but usually in such places as will permit them to raise their flowery heads above the grass, weeds, and low shrubbery, to beckon the insect sponsors necessary for their cross-pollination.

The species ranges from southern Florida to southeastern Georgia.

The specimen here figured came from a woodland margin along the tracks of the Florida East Coast Railroad near Jacksonville, Florida.

"ALPINE FIR

Abies lasiocarpa (Hooker) Nuttall

The alpine fir, commonly called balsam fir in the mountains, is the tree best known to those who follow the trail in the Canadian Rockies, for it is the substitute par excellence for a soft hair mattress, if the bed is properly made, and no sleep is more restful than that obtained on such an aromatic couch of “Rocky Mountain feathers”. From the numerous blisters in the bark a thick juice may be collected which makes an effective dressing for cuts and bruises. The Canada balsam used by microscopists in mounting specimens is obtained from a related species, the balsam fir. By some of the Indian tribes the fir tree was called “cho-koh-tung”, meaning blisters. The wood is soft and coarse-grained and, though it grows rather rapidly, is not of much value commercially. In the lower valleys of the Canadian Rockies, the tree attains to some size, and at timber line holds the final outposts with the Lyall larches, often affording a striking exhibit of nature’s adaptation to adverse conditions of soil, temperature, and wind.

This fir has a wide range. It survived the glacial period in the southern Rocky Mountains, in Northern Arizona and New Mexico, and since the ice retreated has migrated northward along the coast ranges to the Olympic Mountains of Washington, thence into Alaska, and through the eastern Rockies into Alberta, Canada.

The specimen sketched was obtained north of Bow Pass, one day’s ride from the Saskatchewan River, at the foot of Pyramid Peak, at 6,000 feet elevation.

"OCONEE-BELLS

Shortia galacifolia Torrey and Gray

This evergreen, ground-covering plant was for many years one of America’s “lost species”. It had been discovered by Michaux, the French botanist, during his travels in the mountain wilderness of North Carolina in 1788, but the exact spot where he found it long remained unknown, and the dried specimen he had collected, preserved in Paris, was the only proof that such a plant existed. In 1877 the plant was rediscovered, and subsequently found to be fairly abundant in a few restricted areas. I have not seen it in the wild, but Dr. Edgar T. Wherry informs me that it thrives in acid soils on steep slopes along shaded mountain brooks, and that the primroselike white flowers, starring the mats of winter-bronzed foliage in March, produce a charmingly beautiful effect. If transplanted into ordinary garden loam it soon dwindles and dies, but if given acid humus soil it is not hard to grow in cultivation. Oconee-bells is known to the mountaineers as the one-flower coltsfoot, but the common name has been given from its abundance in the Oconee Valley.

Oconee-bells is known to grow only in the Blue Ridge and adjoining parts of the Piedmont region in North and South Carolina. A close relative occurs in Japan, however, indicating that before the glacial period the genus must have spread over both northeastern Asia and northern North America. The ice advances no doubt exterminated some of the species, but the two that chanced to migrate far enough to the southward of the line reached by the ice sheets were preserved.

The specimen painted was grown by Dr. Frederick V. Coville, in acid peat-sand soil, in a greenhouse of the United States Department of Agriculture at Washington.

"VIRGINIA BLUEBELLS

Mertensia virginica (Linnaeus) De Candolle

The lovely Virginia bluebells, with their exquisite bright green leaves, burst forth in unsuspected places in spring. Each year, after the blooming and seeding season, the plants disappear before midsummer, and not until another winter has passed and the spring sun and rains have enticed them from their hiding places, do we again locate them by their tender bronze-green shoots pushing through the moist earth. They love the rich soil of river meadows or the banks of streams, and cover the ground with their masses of bloom and tender green leaves. Virginia bluebells yield easily to cultivation in a wildflower garden, but they are not so well known as other members of the Borage Family, the forget-me-nots and the heliotropes. In Europe, they are much appreciated in cultivated gardens.

Virginia bluebells may be found from Georgia northward to New York and southern Ontario, and westward to Kansas and Minnesota.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Washington, District of Columbia.

"BURGESS MILKVETCH

Astragalus bourgovit Gray

Among the numerous members of the Pea Family, this dainty plant is one of the most appealing. A number of stems grow from a central point and, falling carelessly all around, give the impression of a loose bouquet, the flowers, on their delicate stems, projecting beyond the leaves. The ponies like to eat them, and perfect specimens are difficult to obtain where horses have had access to the colonies.

Burgess milkvetch has a rather restricted range in the northern Rocky Mountains, from South Dakota and Montana to British Columbia. Usually, it is found among partially disintegrated rocks.

This specimen was gathered at Burgess Pass, seven miles by trail from Field, British Columbia, on a northwestern slope, at an elevation of 7,500 feet.

"GREENDRAGON

Arisaema dracontium (Linnaeus) Schott

Greendragon is a vigorous plant and decidedly decorative, though its flower lacks the handsomer coloring of the jack-in-the-pulpit, its near relative. It is, however, of similar habit. Its deeply parted leaves growing on a long stem from the solid globular bulb or corm, reach a height of two feet or more. It loves the same rich, moist woods of low ground frequented by the jack-in-the-pulpit, but is rarely so abundant. The berry-like fruits of the greendragon are red-orange in color, and are clustered in heads that become conspicuous in early autumn. They are much more effective in calling attention to the plant than its green flowers or its foliage.

The range of the greendragon is rather wide, extending from Texas to Florida and northward to Minnesota, Ontario, and Maine.

This specimen grew along the Potomac River above Washington, District of Columbia.

"TOAD TRILLIUM

Trillium sessile Linnaeus

Unlike most other members of its group, this trillium has a rather pleasant odor, but it does not approach other species in attractiveness, for its curious sessile flowers are dull in color. Normally the petals are of a deep maroon color, but in some plants, which show no differences, they are pale greenish yellow. It prefers deep, moist woods, and is easily overlooked among the fresh growths of April or May.

Toad trillium is a typical member of the flora of the Middle Western States, ranging from Mississippi to Florida, northward to Minnesota and western New York; occasionally it crosses the Appalachian Mountains and pushes down river valleys as far north as Maryland and southernmost Pennsylvania.

The specimen sketched grew on Plummers Island in the Potomac River near Washington, District of Columbia.

"SOUTHERN MAGNOLIA

Magnolia grandiflora Linnaeus

This stately magnolia is one of the most conspicuous trees of the southern woods, occasionally attaining a height of seventy feet. It proves hardy in cultivation as far north as Washington. The wonderful creamy flowers, encircled by the large, glossy, evergreen leaves, spring from the ends of almost every branch. Their delightful fragrance immediately attracts attention when the tree is at the height of its glory in June. Several species of beetles patronize the blossoms, enticed by the abundant pollen and nectar.

Today the members of the Magnolia Family found in America are but a remnant of the numerous species that flourished in pre-glacial times from the mid-continental plains to the Arctic Circle. The fossilized trunks found at Amethyst Mountain in Yellowstone Park, with specimens of both fruit and leaves, give an indication of their grandeur and beauty in former ages.

Southern magnolia is native throughout the Southern States from Texas to Florida and northward to Arkansas and southeastern North Carolina. It has been officially adopted as the State flower of both Louisiana and Mississippi.

Magnolia grandiflora Linnaeus

FRUIT OF PLATE 24

As early autumn approaches, the fruit of the southern magnolia becomes conspicuous, and as it ripens the outer envelope cracks over each seed compartment and the crimson seeds protrude from their downy coverings. At this stage the tree affords a striking contrast of red fruit and glossy green leaves. As time passes, the seeds loosen from the shell, but are still attached to the conelike fruit by a slender white thread about an inch long, finally dropping to the ground when the wind blows them loose.

Southern magnolia is found native throughout the Southern States, from Texas to Florida, northward to Arkansas and southeastern North Carolina.

"TRUMPETLEAF

Sarracenia flava Linnaeus

Anyone who has traveled through the South in spring and has been delighted by the fresh verdure of ferns and trees, cannot fail to have been attracted by the great numbers of these curious plants, which can be observed from the car windows. The trumpetleaf is the largest representative of the Pitcherplant Family, the yellow flowers measuring as much as five inches in diameter, and the yellowish-green tubular leaves, frequently veined with red on the pointed lid, growing two to three feet high. The inside of the leaves near the top has a very smooth and slippery waxed surface, so that flies and other insects that are attracted by an exudation just above the waxed surface lose their hold and slide to their death in the digestive liquid which the pitchers contain. All the members of this family have arrangements for utilizing the dead insects to their own advantage.

The trumpetleaf grows in damp acid soils, from northern Florida to the southernmost counties of Virginia.

The specimen sketched was brought into flower by Dr. F. V. Coville in a greenhouse of the Department of Agriculture in Washington. These plants are easy to cultivate if placed in a pot filled with acid soil made from a mixture of peat and sand, and this put into another pot of two inches greater diameter, the space between being filled with sphagnum moss. They should be kept in a cool greenhouse.

"REDBUD

Cercis canadensis Linnaeus

When the dogwood buds are bursting into bloom in early spring, a companion tree, the redbud, is seen throughout our southern woods, its knotted branches covered with clusters of purplish-pink, pea-shaped flowers. In favorable localities the tree attains a height of forty or fifty feet, though usually much smaller. The leaves, which develop after the flowers, are heart-shaped—quite unlike those of most legumes—and are a glossy green, turning to yellow in autumn. The flowers are well supplied with nectar and are most attractive to bees, who visit them in large numbers. In some regions, the redbud is known as Judas-tree, a name properly applied to the Old World species, Cercis siliquastrum.

The tree has a wide range, from Texas to Florida and northward. Though best developed in the South, it has been able to migrate north as far as Minnesota and northern New Jersey, and even a short distance into southern Ontario.

The specimen drawn was collected near Washington, District of Columbia.

"TALL LARKSPUR

Delphinium elongatum Rydberg

Tall larkspur is found in rich mountain valleys, where it loves to grow among the willow clumps that partially shade the soil about its roots. It is usually from two to four feet in height, and if free from other plants has a striking clump of basal leaves, above which rise the long spikes of rich purplish-blue flowers, swaying in the breezes. The power to fertilize themselves having been lost, cross-pollination is effected by bees and butterflies, whose tongues reach into the deep recesses of the flowers where the nectar is hidden. The name Delphinium was given by Linnaeus, from a fancied resemblance of the parts of the flower to a dolphin.

Tall larkspur has a narrow range, being found only from Colorado to Alberta.

The specimen drawn was collected on the Clearwater River, fifty miles north of Lake Louise Station, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.

"RHODORA

Rhodora canadensis Linnaeus

Rhodora is surrounded with romantic interest because of the attention drawn to it by Emerson’s verses. It is the only plant of its genus. The rosy-purple flowers, usually appearing before the leaves, burst suddenly into bloom and form masses of color on wet hillsides or along the margins of acid swamps. Their shape suggests a relationship to the rhododendron, with which this plant is grouped by some botanists. Rhodora bushes grow from one to three feet high and are inconspicuous except when in flower.

The range of rhodora is rather limited; presumably it survived the glacial period near the margins of the ice sheets, and it now occupies glaciated territory from northeastern Pennsylvania to Newfoundland.

The specimen sketched was collected at Pocono Manor, Pennsylvania.

THE RHODORA

In May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes, I found the fresh Rhodora in the woods, spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook, to please the desert and the sluggish brook.

The purple petals, fallen in the pool, made the black water with their beauty gay; here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool, and court the flower that cheapens his array.

Rhodora! if the sages ask thee why this charm is wasted on the earth and sky, tell them, dear, that if eyes were made for seeing, then Beauty is its own excuse for being: why thou were there, O rival of the rose! I never thought to ask, I never knew; but in my simple ignorance suppose the self-same Power that brought me there brought you.

Ralph Waldo Emerson.

"PICKERELWEED

Pontederia cordata Linnaeus

On the flats bordering the Anacostia River in Washington, the rank growths of the various marsh plants form a broad belt of vegetation of striking appearance. Perhaps because of their color, the flowers of pickerelweed are not so conspicuous as those of some other members of the colony, but in spite of this, its glossy green leaves, borne well above the surface of the water, and its ragged spikes of small blue or lavender flowers, continuing in bloom through most of the summer, are a delight to behold. Without a boat, it is almost impossible to gather the blooms, growing from the soft mud that supports the outer phalanxes of aquatic plants. The flowers of the pickerelweed, which last but a single day, are in three forms. They do not produce seeds without the aid of insects, and it is an interesting study to examine them in detail with a glass and note the complicated structure by which they are able to obtain the greatest amount of benefit from their insect visitors. Giulio Pontedera, professor of botany at Padua about 1730, is commemorated by the generic name.

Pickerelweed is found from Florida to Texas and northward to Minnesota and Nova Scotia, and grows also in tropical America.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Washington, District of Columbia.

"CREEPING HOLLYGRAPE

Berberis repens Lindley

The shiny, prickly leaves of the hollygrape are so nearly like holly, that upon first glance we may think we have found that tree, reduced to a bush or low plant creeping over the ground. Closer inspection reveals many differences, for the berries, growing in a bunch, are of a lovely blue color—almost like small grapes—with plenty of bloom. They are rather pungent and sour to the taste, but are good for jelly or for making a refreshing drink, most welcome to quench the thirst when climbing a mountainside. As autumn approaches, the leaves change to red, either all over or around their borders, and are then most attractive in coloring. They remain upon the plant all winter.

Creeping hollygrape is found from California and New Mexico to Alberta and British Columbia. The Oregon hollygrape, Berberis aquifolium, often known as Oregon grape, has been designated the State flower of Oregon, by vote of the legislature. Three species of hollygrape occur abundantly in the Pacific Northwest.

The specimen sketched was gathered in Sinclair Canyon, Columbia River Valley in British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"RED CHOKEBERRY

Aronia arbutifolia (Linnaeus filius) Elliott

The red chokeberry is a small shrub found in low grounds, swamps, and dry open woods, and though not particular as to moisture in choosing a situation, usually prefers rather acid soils. The cymes and the under surface of the leaves are woolly, and in spring, when in full bloom, it is a graceful and handsome plant.

Examination of the individual flowers will show them to resemble those of the pear tree in structure, and the plant is referred by botanists to that group of the Rose Family which includes the pear, apple, and hawthorn.

Red chokeberry may be found from Louisiana and Florida to Minnesota and Nova Scotia.

The flowers sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

PLATE 31",RED CHOKEBERRY,Aronia arbutifolia (Linnaeus filius) Elliott,Red chokeberry may be found from Louisiana and Florida to Minnesota and Nova Scotia.,"The flowers sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.",31,31,42602703,District of Columbia,USA
"RED CHOKEBERRY

Aronia arbutifolia (Linnaeus filius) Elliott

The fruit of the red chokeberry ripens in August or September, and later in the season the whole bush becomes a gorgeous mass of orange and scarlet color. The fruits are shaped like miniature pears, and this, together with their bright coloring, often tempts the stranger to taste them, but the result is sure to be a disappointment, for they are excessively sour as well as bitter. The birds do not seem to mind this feature, however, and consume them greedily during the winter months. A bush or two should be planted in the garden of every bird lover.

The red chokeberry ranges throughout the eastern United States and into southernmost Canada.

Like the flowers, the spray of berries sketched is from the vicinity of Washington, District of Columbia.

"DEVILSCLUB

Oplopanax horridum (Smith) Decaisne and Planchon

The devilsclub is a sturdy shrub, rising above the ground four or five feet on stout prickly stems. The maple-like leaves spread from the stems about a foot below the red berries, and hide the ground, so that one is not aware of its terrible spines until he tries to walk through a thicket. No heavy woolen garment or leather shoe is stout enough to withstand the bristling, hard, gray spines. Without the help of an axe and a strong arm behind it, the thickets of devilsclub in the Selkirk Mountains are often almost impenetrable. The scarlet berries are very showy in late summer.

This plant belongs to the Aralia Family, which includes other spiny shrubs, such as the Herculesclub of the southeastern United States, as well as ginseng and wild-sarsaparilla.

The range of the devilsclub is from Oregon, Montana, and Michigan to Alaska.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"CRESTED IRIS

Iris cristata Aiton

The crested iris is dwarf in habit and its lance-shaped leaves of bright green taper at each end. The flowers, which appear in May, seem out of proportion to the size of the plant. Their broad outer divisions or petals have yellow, raised flutings along the center, which give rise to the name. This lovely plant yields easily to cultivation in a wild garden, being relatively indifferent as to soil reaction, but requiring plenty of humus and enough rocks to ensure good drainage.

The crested iris may be found from Georgia to Maryland and west to Missouri and southern Indiana.

This specimen was sketched at Plummers Island in the Potomac River near Washington, District of Columbia.

PLATE 33",CRESTED IRIS,Iris cristata Aiton,The crested iris may be found from Georgia to Maryland and west to Missouri and southern Indiana.,"This specimen was sketched at Plummers Island in the Potomac River near Washington, District of Columbia.",33,33,42602700,District of Columbia,USA
"LILY TWAYBLADE

Liparis ligulata (Linnaeus) Richard

This little orchid is inconspicuous where it grows, on account of its protective coloring, which blends so perfectly with its surroundings, though a fascinating plant when examined closely. It blooms in May and has two rich green leaves that clasp the flower stem and grow from a solid perennial bulb. It is the easiest to cultivate of all our native orchids, not being particular as to the reaction of the soil, although it prefers an abundance of humus.

The lily twayblade extends from Missouri to Georgia and northward, and since the ice of the glacial period retreated has succeeded in migrating as far north as Minnesota and Maine.

The specimen sketched grew on High Island in the Potomac River near Washington, District of Columbia.

"MISSOURI PRICKLYPEAR

Opuntia polyacantha Haworth

The Missouri pricklypear is one of the commonest of the cactuses. The flowers are so beautiful that one forgets the wicked spines and the still more dangerous spicules, which are found on the thick stems of flat joints, until one endeavors to gather them. In the bright sunshine of early morning the dry prairies in some sections are dotted with masses of pale sulphur-yellow flowers, turning salmon in the late afternoon as they fade. The sensitive stamens are sometimes yellow and sometimes red, while the stigma-lobes, in the center, are always green. The irritable stamens are one of the provisions which nature makes to bring about cross-pollination. Bees visit the cactus flowers to obtain the nectar. When one of them settles upon the stamens, which spread widely apart in bright sunlight, these at once turn inward and downward, covering the insect and depositing the pollen on its back, legs, and head. This pollen is then carried by the insect to the next flower and dropped upon its stigma-lobes. Below the bright-colored petals is the spiny ovary, which ripens into a dry, many-seeded fruit, this pricklypear being one of the few which are not juicy.

The Missouri pricklypear may be found in dry places from New Mexico, Missouri, and Wisconsin to Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 3,500 feet, a locality near the northern range of this species and also near the northern limit of the Cactus Family.

"BUTTERFLY WEED

Asclepias tuberosa Linnaeus

The butterflyweed is probably our most beautiful orange-colored wildflower. Growing in poor sandy soil, it forms masses of brilliant color wherever it finds a congenial foothold. The plants are visited by hosts of butterflies, some of them especially adapted to the cross-pollination of the flowers, which have entirely lost the ability to fertilize themselves. Only insects with long tongues can reach the nectar hidden in the deep recesses of the complicated blossoms, whose structure definitely places the plant in the Milkweed Family. Curiously enough, however, its juice is not milky. The Indians are said to have used the long roots of this and other milkweeds as a remedy for various maladies, and herb doctors of a later day use them under the name of pleurisy-root. Linnaeus dedicated the family to Aesculapius on account of its alleged healing qualities, though the name, as he spelled it, is a Latinized corruption. The plant yields easily to cultivation, provided it is planted in dry, sterile soil, and should be grown in every wildflower garden with bright sunny exposure.

Butterfly weed has a wide range, extending from Florida to northern Mexico and north to Maine, Ontario, Minnesota, and Colorado.

The specimen sketched was found near Washington, District of Columbia.

"SKUNKCABBAGE

Spathyema foetida (Linnaeus) Rafinesque

This first plant to flower in spring is easily found in swampy places, where the richly colored, hooded spathe is seen pushing its way through the moist earth, sometimes before the ground is free of snow. When one peeps inside the hood, the small flowers are found dotting the spadix more or less regularly. The rank insistent odor attracts many flesh flies. The leaves come through the earth before the flower has faded, and grow rapidly into showy, light green clumps, from one to three feet high. At this time the odor is very strong. The fruit ripens in September.

Like most of the members of the Arum Family, the skunkcabbage is rather southern in its distribution, ranging from Missouri to Florida and northward, locally reaching Minnesota and Maine, or even Nova Scotia.

The specimen sketched was found along Piney Branch, Washington, District of Columbia.

PLATE 37",SKUNKCABBAGE,Spathyema foetida (Linnaeus) Rafinesque,"Like most of the members of the Arum Family, the skunkcabbage is rather southern in its distribution, ranging from Missouri to Florida and northward, locally reaching Minnesota and Maine, or even Nova Scotia.","The specimen sketched was found along Piney Branch, Washington, District of Columbia.",37,37,42602666,District of Columbia,USA
"RED-OSIER DOGWOOD

Cornus stolonifera Michaux

The red-osier dogwood is an attractive shrub, not only when in bloom but also in the early fall, when its bunches of bluish-white berries are borne in abundance, and the leaves change in color to scarlet, purple, or gold. The Indians used the scraped inner bark for smoking purposes and preferred it to any other plant, giving it the name ‘kinnikinnick’. In winter, the slender, graceful, purplish-red stems are conspicuous and distinctive.

Red-osier dogwood may be found from Virginia to Newfoundland, and from Mexico to Alaska, and at many places in the interior of the continent.

The specimen sketched grew at Radium Hot Springs, in the Columbia River Valley, British Columbia, at 3,000 feet elevation.

"BIRDSFOOT VIOLET

Viola pedata Linnaeus

The birdsfoot violet is one of the most beautiful members of the Violet Family. The velvety purple color of the two upper petals, combined with the pale blue-violet shade of the three lower ones, contrasted with the bright orange anthers nestling in the center, immediately attracts the attention of all who love wild flowers. Bumblebees, also yellow butterflies, visit the flowers and partake of the sweets prepared for their enjoyment. When soil and exposure are favorable, the ground is purple with the lovely blossoms, the absence of scent being the only flaw in their perfection.

This plant prefers a dry situation where the soil is poor, sterile, and acid, and should not be transferred to a wildflower garden unless satisfied in this respect, for in ordinary rich loam it will promptly die. It will thrive best if planted in coarse gravel richly charged with decaying wood and so rendered thoroughly acid. The small bulblike rootstock is so poorly anchored in the soil and so easily lifted from its moorings, that frequently it comes up when one attempts to pick the flowers. Great care should therefore be taken in gathering them.

This violet is found from Louisiana to Florida, Minnesota, and Massachusetts, the dark purple variety being much more frequent in the southern portion of the range.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Washington, District of Columbia.

"VIRGINIA SPIDERWORT

Tradescantia virginiana Linnaeus

The Virginia spiderwort loves the rich borders of woods and thickets, and is loveliest in the morning, when its blue petals open wide, showing the golden anthers in sharp contrast. The plant continues in bloom for some time, new flowers opening each morning, and enticing the bees to a fresh feast of nectar. These insect visitors are necessary to cross-fertilization, and carry from one blossom to the next a heavy load of pollen.

The genus is named for John Tradescant, gardener to King Charles I of England, and belongs in the same family as the dayflower. This and the Pickerelweed Family are closely related.

The Virginia spiderwort may be found from Virginia to Arkansas, northward to South Dakota and southern New York.

The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"LEATHERFLOWER

Clematis viorna Linnaeus

The leatherflower is not so showy as the other members of the clematis group, nevertheless its graceful stems and leaves and reddish purple blossoms are not uninteresting. The sepals are remarkable in being a sixteenth of an inch thick, as if made of leather instead of the delicate tissue usual in flowers in which petals are lacking and the sepals are required to take their place. The feathery fruit, more attractive than the flowers, is erect and silky, each individual ""seed"" possessing a tail almost two inches long, by means of which it may be carried by the wind, when ripe, to a favorable situation.

This scrambling vine may be found in thickets where the soil is rocky but rather rich, from Alabama and Georgia northward to Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The sketch was made from a specimen gathered near Washington, District of Columbia.

"PURPLE SAXIFRAGE

Saxifraga oppositifolia Linnaeus

The purple saxifrage is truly an alpine plant. In the Canadian Rockies it is found above tree line near the melting snows on southern slopes, where it comes quickly into bloom in the long days of early summer, and as quickly is past, leaving the matted rosettes of tiny, bright green leaves, dotted with dull red seed capsules, to reward our search, if, perchance, we are a few days too late to find it in bloom. It delights in disintegrated limestone, often growing in cracks between the rocks. Though plentiful in its chosen situation, it is not often seen by visitors, who must make a hard climb to reach its haunts. In Alaska and near the Arctic Circle, it finds the most favorable conditions for perfect development, growing into large mats.

The purple saxifrage is typical of Arctic regions throughout the world, and no doubt survived the glacial period close to the margins of the great ice sheets. When these withdrew, it followed back on the bare rock surfaces. It is now found occasionally in the northern United States, from Wyoming to Vermont, and more abundantly northward.

The specimen sketched grew on the slopes of Fossil Mountain near Baker Lake, seven miles northeast of Lake Louise Station, Alberta, at an altitude of 8,000 feet.

"FLAME AZALEA

Azalea lutea Linnaeus

The flame azalea is the most conspicuous of the native members of this genus. Its brilliant orange or yellow coloring, frequently suffused with red, attracts attention even from a distance, and when the mountain sides are flecked with it, the effect is particularly striking. The green leaves, which are well developed before the flowers open, add greatly to the beauty of the plant. It yields easily to cultivation and under favorable conditions, when grown with other plants requiring an acid soil, is one of the loveliest native shrubs for planting.

Flame azalea is a typical member of the flora of our Southern Appalachians, ranging from the uplands of Georgia northward, and being abundant as far as West Virginia. In the mountains of Pennsylvania it is rare, and though reported many years ago to grow in southern New York State, it has long since disappeared from there as a native plant.

The sketch was made from a specimen obtained near Linville, North Carolina.

"RABBITBEAN

Cracca virginiana Linnaeus

The gray-green foliage of the rabbitbean makes a delightful background for its straw-colored, pea-shaped flowers, touched with red, and crowded at the end of a stiff stem. The plant blooms in early summer and is to be found in dry, sandy, acid soil. Should you wish to gather a bunch, you will find the stems and the unusually long roots surprisingly tough, and a serviceable substitute for twine, if necessity demands. It is, indeed, commonly known in the South as devil's shoe-string.

The seeds are in bean-shaped pods, which are frequently rifled by weevils, so that few of them ever reach maturity.

The Indians used a tropical American species of this genus as fish poison in the same manner in which they employed many other plants, throwing the macerated stems into quiet streams or ponds, with the result that the fish became stupefied and floated on the surface of the water, so that they were easily taken.

Rabbitbean ranges from Texas to Florida and northward to Manitoba and Ontario.

The specimen sketched was collected near Washington, District of Columbia.

"TULIPTREE

Liriodendron tulipifera Linnaeus

This beautiful tree is a joy to behold at any season of the year. Its bare gray branches outlined against the winter sky impress one with their vigor of growth and sturdy health, and when the warmer days and April showers swell the buds, and the tiny young leaves appear, the tree bursts into its supreme glory. If in a sunny situation, it is soon covered with green tulip-shaped flowers, each cup beautifully decorated with a brilliant orange bar, to entice the visiting bees. In autumn the leaves are a mass of orange and gold.

The tuliptree is the only member of the genus Liriodendron in America, though a closely related species flourishes in central China, these two being the sole survivals of the Cretaceous Period, when members of the genus were widely distributed in America and Europe. Though it reaches its greatest size in the lower Ohio Basin, sometimes growing almost 200 feet high, it is found in the eastern United States from Louisiana to Florida and northward to Michigan and southern Vermont.

The wood has a variety of commercial uses, while the bark, especially that of the roots, yields a tonic and heart stimulant. The blossom of the tuliptree is the State flower of Indiana.

The specimen sketched was obtained at Washington, District of Columbia.

"TRUMPET HONEYSUCKLE

Lonicera sempervirens Linnaeus

While tramping through open woods or along streams in low ground, the attention may be attracted to a bit of red color quite in contrast to the brown leaves and gray tree trunks or low-growing bushes. Closer inspection reveals the gray stems that lead to the leafy shoots above, where the delicate trumpet-shaped flowers are clustered at the ends of the branches. Few vines are more attractive; the plant seems to poise itself in the most graceful way as it climbs from one supporting shrub to another.

The flower is a great favorite with hummingbirds, which frequently are seen probing the trumpets to obtain the delicious nectar to be found in them.

The fruit is a brilliant scarlet berry. The plant is a great addition to any wild garden.

Trumpet honeysuckle ranges from Texas to Florida, and northward to Nebraska, its northern limit being reached in New York and southern New England.

The specimen sketched was collected at Yemassee, South Carolina.

"RED BUCKEYE

Aesculus pavia Linnaeus

The red buckeye is a straggling, inconspicuous shrub in the southern woods until it comes into bloom, when it immediately attracts attention by its bright red flowers which are borne in a loose spike. The stems of the new growths also are red at blooming time, and the tender green leaves with their red stems make an appropriate setting for the flower spikes. It is usually a shrub three or four feet high, but in favorable situations it sometimes attains tree size, although never approaching the stature of its relatives, the Ohio buckeye and the horsechestnut.

Red buckeye is a southern species, ranging from Texas to Florida, and extending northward as far as southern Missouri and southeastern Virginia.

The specimen sketched was collected near Beaufort, South Carolina.

"ROSE PAINTBRUSH

Castilleja pallida (Linnaeus) Kunth

Crossing alpine meadows above tree line and on high passes in the Canadian Rockies, one often finds the drier ground covered with masses of rose paintbrush, growing in company with saxifrages and forget-me-nots, wherever soil resulting from the disintegrating rock has been deposited. The rose paintbrush varies from two to eight inches in height, according to altitude and local conditions. The leafy bracts, often mistaken for petals, range in color from greenish-white or pale yellow to various shades of mulberry or dull pink. The actual flowers have a dull-colored corolla, and are concealed between the bracts. The plant belongs to the Figwort Family.

Rose paintbrush grows from Alberta and British Columbia to Alaska, and also in Siberia.

The specimen sketched was obtained on the Clearwater River thirty miles north of Lake Louise Station in British Columbia, at an altitude of 8,000 feet.

"SHOOTINGSTAR

Dodecatheon meadia Linnaeus

Shootingstar is not particular in choosing a habitat, for it is found in open woods, on moist hillsides, or where the meadows broaden into prairies. It belongs to the Primrose Family, and is distantly related to the Asiatic cyclamen familiar in cultivation, being in fact sometimes called wild cyclamen. It thrives in rich garden soil, where the flowers often become larger than in the wild state, and it should find a place in our gardens.

This species of shootingstar has a rather wide distribution, ranging through the prairies, where the flowers are often red, from Texas to Georgia, and northward into Manitoba; it also extends eastward through the Appalachians, reaching the Piedmont from North Carolina to Pennsylvania. The genus Dodecatheon is best represented in the West, where many species occur.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Washington, District of Columbia.

PLATE 49",SHOOTINGSTAR,Dodecatheon meadia Linnaeus,"This species of shootingstar has a rather wide distribution, ranging through the prairies, where the flowers are often red, from Texas to Georgia, and northward into Manitoba; it also extends eastward through the Appalachians, reaching the Piedmont from North Carolina to Pennsylvania.","The specimen sketched was obtained near Washington, District of Columbia.",49,49,42602678,District of Columbia,USA
"PRAIRIE PENTSTEMON

Pentstemon erizanthera Pursh

Prairie pentstemon is one of a large genus of plants, embracing about one hundred and forty species, all of which are natives of North America. Wherever present, they are likely to be found in great numbers, especially in the West, where they are very conspicuous. This species grows in small clumps on dry hillsides. Its large flowers are wonderfully varied in coloration, ranging from blue, through various shades of dull purple, to pale pink. They belong in the Figwort Family.

The prairie pentstemon may be found from Nevada, Nebraska, and North Dakota to British Columbia and Washington.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Sinclair Hot Springs, in the Columbia River Valley, British Columbia, at an elevation of 2,500 feet.

"WILD SWEET CRAB

Malus coronaria (Linnaeus) Miller

What sweeter blossoms are to be found in spring than those of the wild sweet crab? It is usually a low bushy tree, growing perhaps twenty feet high, with tangled branches making a flat top, quite inconspicuous in its wild surroundings. But when early spring is past, and the bushes are masses of tender green, the pink buds appear, and soon the whole is covered with lovely flowers, whose sweet scent is wafted far on every breeze. The fruit, also, is sweet-scented, and can be made into elegant delicious jelly.

The wild sweet crab is a native of the Central States, extending from Louisiana and Alabama northward to Michigan and Ontario, but in cultivation over a much wider range.

This specimen was collected near Washington, District of Columbia.

"PITCHERPLANT

Sarracenia purpurea Linnaeus

The pitcherplant is found in peat bogs, where the acid soil provides ideal conditions for its successful growth. The pitcher-shaped leaves grow from a central crown, and are partially filled with water and a digestive substance. The inner surfaces of the leaves are lined with bristles which project downward, and these prevent many small insects that slide into the water from escaping. Thus they are trapped, drowned, and digested. These dead insects are also used as food by the larvae of several species of sarcophagous flies, which are instrumental in the cross-pollination of the flower, and are always found where the pitcherplant grows.

The flowers are borne on a stem from six inches to two feet tall, a vigorous plant often yielding seven or eight blossoms.

A cool greenhouse is necessary for successful indoor cultivation. It is well to place the plant in a flower pot filled with acid soil made from a mixture of peat and sand, and to set this pot inside another of two inches greater diameter, the space between the two being filled with sphagnum moss, which should be kept moist.

The pitcherplant is one of the plants that was pushed southward by the ice cap during glacial times. Since the great ice sheet retreated it has been gradually moving northward, and now ranges from Florida to Kentucky and Iowa, and north to Labrador and Manitoba.

The specimen sketched was collected in eastern Maryland.

PLATE 52",PITCHERPLANT,Sarracenia purpurea Linnaeus,"The pitcherplant is one of the plants that was pushed southward by the ice cap during glacial times.

"PRAIRIE-SMOKE

Szeversia ciliata (Pursh) Don

This pretty and graceful plant grows in grassy meadows, where its red flowers, which resemble buds, its crimson stems, and plumed fruit immediately attract attention. In late summer the silky fruit heads give to dense patches of the plants dispersed over the plains, a purplish hazy appearance, when viewed from a distance.

The plant belongs to that group of the Rose Family which includes the cinquefoils and barren-strawberries, and is most nearly related to the geums, being in fact listed in some books as Geum triflorum.

As its name suggests, this plant is typical of the prairie region of the United States, ranging from New Mexico to Missouri and northward. It extends well up into the eastern valleys of the Rocky Mountains, as far north as Alberta, and has also migrated across southern Canada and the northern United States as far as Maine.

The specimen sketched was collected near Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"WINTERBERRY

Ilex verticillata (Linnaeus) Gray

In spring, when all nature is awakening, we easily overlook this inconspicuous shrub, from four to six feet tall, with tender leaves and tiny flowers, growing in damp acid ground among the other denizens of neglected places. But when autumn passes and the stems are stripped of their leaves, the fine red berries come into their own, and lend a delightful touch of color to the winter landscape. The whole top of the bush is covered with berries, and it then vies with its cousin, the holly, in beauty and interest, and in radiating Christmas cheer and goodwill.

The berries stay on the branches till late winter, and are rarely eaten by birds. A form with yellow fruit has been found in New England.

Another member of the genus Ilex is the well-known shrub, maté, whose leaves are largely used in South America for making a beverage similar to Chinese tea. From yaupon, an Ilex of our Southern States, the Indians make a stimulating drink, and it is now being placed on the market, under the name Cassina, as a substitute for tea.

Winterberry ranges from Missouri to Florida, and northward to Wisconsin and Nova Scotia.

The specimen sketched was collected near Washington, District of Columbia.

"SWEET AZALEA

Azalea arborescens Pursh

The sweet azalea is one of the contributions to our flora from the Appalachian Mountains, where so many attractive plants were found by the early botanists. Its delightfully fragrant, spicy, white flowers appear in June when the leaves are well developed and afford a fine green background for the blossoms. The foliage often turns brilliant red in late autumn.

The plant loves a well drained, deep, moist, acid soil, and under favorable conditions becomes a spreading clump, which blooms freely. It is perhaps the largest of our native azaleas, occasionally attaining a height of twenty feet.

Sweet azalea occurs in the mountains from Georgia northward into Pennsylvania.

The sketch was made from a plant found in the vicinity of Linville, North Carolina, at the foot of Grandfather Mountain.

"KRUHSEA

Kruhsea streptopoides (Ledebour) Kearney

Anyone who has visited Glacier House, and walked to the foot of the Illecillewaet Glacier, may have noticed beds of shiny green-leaved plants suggestive of a small Solomon's seal. The tiny greenish, bell-shaped flowers hang from the under side of the stem, however, and are usually missed by the transient visitor, whose efforts are centered merely on climbing the trail to reach the edge of the ice. This rare member of the Lily-of-the-valley Family has a somewhat restricted range, and is especially interesting because it is one of those plants common to both the American and Asiatic shores of the Pacific Ocean.

It may be found from northern Washington to southern Alaska and in the Selkirks of British Columbia; also in Japan and Siberia.

The specimen sketched grew at Glacier, British Columbia, at an elevation of 3,500 feet.

"KRUHSEA

Kruhsea streptopotdes (Ledebour) Kearney

The change wrought in vegetation during a few weeks of growing weather is very great in mountain regions at the latitude of Glacier House, and when autumn approaches, the tiny green flowers of Kruhsea have developed rapidly into large, pulpy, red berries, which contrast strikingly with the yellow leaves and soon fall to the ground.

On this continent Kruhsea grows from northern Washington to southern Alaska, and in Asia it is recorded from both Japan and Siberia.

The specimen sketched was obtained at the same locality as the flowers shown in the preceding plate, at Glacier, British Columbia, at 3,500 feet elevation.

"ARETHUSA

Arethusa bulbosa Linnaeus

The arethusa has a single large, one-sided flower with a delicate scent like that of fresh red raspberries. The recurved lip, with its fringes, forms a capital landing platform for visiting insects. As with many other orchids, the bees are frequent visitors to this plant. The flower is so constructed that the bee, in raising his head to depart after sipping the nectar, comes in contact with a few soft pellets of pollen, which are deposited upon his head from the helmet-shaped anther. Some of this pollen may be transferred to the stigmas of the next flower that he visits, although more often it is brushed off by other parts of the flower. Because of the infrequency of cross-pollination, seeds rarely mature.

The name was given to the plant by Linnaeus, who recalled the myth of the nymph Arethusa, changed by Diana into a fountain, in order to protect her from the river god Alphaeus, who fell deeply in love with her on seeing her at her bath.

Owing to the great demand for this orchid by European collectors, it has been nearly exterminated in many sphagnum bogs where it formerly grew in great abundance.

Arethusa may be found from North Carolina north to Maine and Newfoundland, and westward to Indiana and Minnesota.

The specimen sketched was obtained from a swamp a few miles east of Washington, District of Columbia, where the plant is extremely rare.

"PALE LADYSLIPPER

Cypripedium acaule Aiton

The pale ladyslipper is even lovelier than the common form of this beautiful orchid, which has pink flowers. The pale form is frequent in the North, but one who is so fortunate as to find it in the more southern part of its range experiences a thrill that is not likely to be forgotten. If the soil is kept strongly acid, the plant will readily yield to culture in a wildflower garden, and will flourish in either dry or moist situations, and in sun or shade. A dressing of pine needles or oak leaves will help to conserve the moisture, as well as the acidity of the soil. No attempt should be made, however, to cultivate it in regular garden soil, for there it is sure to die.

The pale ladyslipper may be found from North Carolina and Tennessee northward to Manitoba and Newfoundland.

The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"QUAKER LADIES

Houstonia caerulea Linnaeus

Quakerladies, sometimes called bluets and innocence, are among our earliest spring flowers, and delight flower lovers by their dainty growth and faint, sweet odor. Occurring plentifully in moist meadows and wayside places, they sometimes completely carpet the ground. They may be gathered freely, without fear of extermination. They continue blooming into early summer, and frequently put forth a second bloom in late fall. No wildflower garden would be complete without them, a rather sterile and acid soil and a fair amount of sunshine being all that they ask.

Linnaeus named this plant in honor of Dr. William Houston, a young English botanist, who died in South America after an exhausting collecting trip around the Gulf of Mexico in 1733.

Quakerladies are widely distributed, being found from Georgia and Alabama northward to eastern Canada and Michigan.

The plant sketched grew at Washington, District of Columbia.

"BEARBERRY HONEYSUCKLE

Lonicera involucrata (Richardson) Banks

Bearberry honeysuckle is a plant that is conspicuous in July when the fruit ripens. The coarse, hairy leaves are of a dark rich green, and the twin berries, glossy black in color, are surrounded by a red frill, a combination which makes the bush very decorative. The unpretentious straw-colored flowers may sometimes be found on the younger branches along with the fruit produced by those that come into bloom earlier. If the bush is shaken, the ripe fruit falls easily. Its disagreeable flavor has gained for it the name of skunkberry in some regions.

Bearberry honeysuckle may be found from Quebec to Michigan, New Mexico, and California, and northward to Alaska.

The specimen sketched was collected near Hector, British Columbia, at an elevation of 4,000 feet.

"PINK FLEABANE

Erigeron caespitosus Nuttall

The pink fleabane may be seen in great perfection in June in the upper Columbia River Valley. It seems to delight in dry, sandy soils, and especially after a shower, its graceful clumps of daisylike flowers, variously shaded from white to pink or pale purple, are a delight to the eye. It is a member of a group of plants widely distributed in North America, and represented in the Rocky Mountains by a hundred or more species.

Pink fleabane ranges from Colorado and Utah to the Yukon.

The specimen drawn was collected in the Saskatchewan River Valley, fifty miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"LABRADOR-TEA

Ledum groenlandicum Oeder

Who that has traveled by the Canadian Pacific Railway in June, along the north shore of Lake Superior and across the boggy country traversed by that railroad, has not noticed the masses of low bushes covered with feathery heads of white flowers? When the mountains are reached we still find the shrub growing luxuriantly in full sunshine or adapting itself to more shaded situations, provided the ground is sufficiently wet. The margins of the leaves are rolled, and their under surface is covered with brown wool.

The leaves have an aromatic fragrance, and were used by the early settlers as a substitute for tea, but the beverage is rather too much like turpentine to be palatable.

Labrador-tea is one of the members of the Heath Family and is at home in northern regions. During the glacial period it probably survived near the margins of the ice sheets, and when these melted back, followed them closely and became widespread in the glaciated territory, wherever acid soils developed. It now grows from the highlands of New Jersey northward and westward far into the Rocky Mountains and the Arctic regions. It was in fact given the specific name groenlandicum because it was first discovered in Greenland.

The specimen sketched came from the White Mountains in New Hampshire.

"NORTHERN BEDSTRAW

Galium boreale Linnaeus

In many parts of North America, northern bedstraw is a familiar plant. Although essentially northern in its distribution, as its name implies, it is not an Arctic plant but seems to thrive best in regions of only moderately cold climate. In the central and southern Rockies, it is abundant at middle and high altitudes, but farther north, it frequents the foothills, extending out upon the plains. The plant sometimes forms dense clumps which afford a bouquet of feathery white flower sprays that are delicately scented. In the Rockies, the name wild heliotrope is occasionally applied to the plant, although its fragrance is scarcely suggestive of our garden heliotrope.

Northern bedstraw grows in a great variety of situations, on open banks among rocks and grasses, in aspen thickets, or along streams, where the abundant moisture develops luxuriant plants that are sometimes two feet high. The species ranges from Pennsylvania, Missouri, and southern California, northward over the greater part of Canada and Alaska, and is widely distributed also in northern Europe and Asia.

This plant is one of a large group of the Madder Family, some members of which produce, in their roots, a red or purple dye. Most of our American bedstraws are unattractive plants, with weak rough stems and insignificant flowers.

The sketch was made from a specimen found near Banff, Alberta, Canada.

"BRONZEBELLS

Stenanthium occidentale Gray

Bronzebells is so delicate and graceful a lily, and has such a modest coloring of green and dark maroon, that it is almost hidden among the vegetation of the moist rich woods, where it prefers to grow. Flowering in company with Rocky Mountain rhododendron and menziesia, it is always a delight to the lover of the beautiful who has eyes to see the variety in nature’s handiwork, and will search for her hidden treasures.

Bronzebells ranges from Montana and Oregon to Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the Yoho Valley, ten miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.

"ROUNDLEAF ORCHIS

Orchis rotundifolia Pursh

The roundleaf orchis loves the wet shores of alpine lakes and frequently grows in sphagnum moss along the borders of mountain brooks in partially shaded, wet places. Where conditions are favorable it occurs in abundance, though often overlooked by the flower lover because of larger and tankier plants surrounding it. The single rounded leaf is a distinguishing characteristic, and the sweet scent of the flowers is so pervasive that it sometimes attracts attention before the bloom is discovered. Except for a single Alaskan species, it is the only American member of a group represented in Europe and Asia by eighty species or more.

The roundleaf orchis is a plant of northern range and is not known to grow south of the limits reached by the ice sheets of the glacial period. It must have survived close to the edge of the ice, and migrated back rapidly when this retreated. Although it died out from the places where it survived glaciation, it has subsequently spread across the continent, from northern Maine to British Columbia and northward to Greenland and Alaska.

The specimen sketched grew at Emerald Lake, seven miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,800 feet.

"PRICKLY CURRANT

Ribes lacustre (Persoon) Poiret

The prickly currant is a beautiful bush when in bloom. Its graceful branches are then ornamented with dainty racemes of yellowish flowers, shaded with red, and the delicate green leaves are of a tint best suited to show them off to perfection. When growing on a steep slope, with full exposure to the sun, the plant is so pleasing that one wonders why it has not been transplanted to cultivated gardens.

Prickly currant is found from Pennsylvania to Newfoundland and from California to Alaska.

The specimen sketched was collected on the slopes of Mt. Wapta, ten miles by trail from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

"PRICKLY CURRANT

Ribes lacustre (Persoon) Poiret

Though never very abundant, the prickly currant is found in some regions of the Rocky Mountains in sufficient quantity to furnish a delightful dish. When stewed and eaten with venison or wild mutton, it makes a deliciously spicy sauce. When raw, the berries are rather sour, and are eaten only for want of something better.

Prickly currant may be found from Pennsylvania to Newfoundland and from California to Alaska.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Glacier Lake, on the headwaters of the Saskatchewan River, fifty miles north of Lake Louise, British Columbia, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"GLACIER LILY

Erythronium grandiflorum Pursh

The glacier lily seems to radiate the spirit of the high places, and with bright sunshine and pure air helps to entice the lover of nature to the mountain tops. Along the edges of the melting snow the pointed, green, dagger-like leaves push upward, often through the snow itself, and soon the flower bursts into bloom, exhaling a delicious fragrance quite distinct from any other we experienced in the mountains. Carpeting the ground with gold, the plant may be found even in mid-summer, along with spring beauties, yellow violets, and buttercups, where the spring avalanches have lodged their load of snow and thus held the early flowers in cold storage. The name avalanche lily is often applied to it because of this fact. At lower altitudes, it grows in greater numbers and with longer stems, but always with the same lovely coloring of brilliant green and gold. It is rarely found below an elevation of 4,000 feet.

The glacier lily is evidently adapted to grow in regions of heavy snowfall, and no doubt survived the glacial period close to the edge of the ice from Wyoming to Washington, having since pushed northward into the mountains of British Columbia and Alberta.

The specimen sketched was obtained on the slopes of Mt. Wapta, above Emerald Lake near Field, in the Canadian Rockies, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"BALSAMROOT

Balsamorhiza sagittata (Pursh) Nuttall

Wherever it is found, balsamroot is a striking plant. The arrow-shaped leaves, blue-green on the upper surface and white on the underside, are borne on stalks five or six inches long, above which the handsome yellow flowers are poised on still longer stems. When in bloom these plants brighten whole mountain sides with gold. The plant prefers moist situations on partially shaded, steep slopes, but in the lower valleys it frequents the borders of swampy land, among coarse grass and alder and willow bushes. The horses love to feed upon it and will never pass a fine clump in perfection of leaf and bloom unless urged on. The large fleshy roots are eaten by the Indians, and in Utah they are commonly called Mormon biscuit, because of their use by the early immigrants in times of scarcity.

Balsamroot is distributed from Colorado and California to British Columbia and South Dakota.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"SILVERBERRY

Elaeagnus commutata Bernhardi

After crossing the plains and coming into the foothill country, the traveler will observe many thickets of silvery-gray shrubs. In June, on approaching these clumps he is greeted by the peculiar sweet scent of the greenish funnel-shaped bells, with yellow petals, that hang from the undersides of the branches. The leaves, when examined under a lens, are seen to be covered with silvery scales. Similar scales covering the fruit have given the plant the name silverberry. It is nearly related to the buffaloberry, and often grows with it. Both are members of the group of plants known as the Oleaster Family, which is considered by botanists to belong in the same order as the loosestrifes and evening primroses.

Silverberry is found from Quebec to Minnesota and from Utah to the Yukon.

The specimen sketched was collected near Ghost River, twenty-five miles northeast of Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"SILVERBERRY

Elaeagnus commutata Bernhard

We had known the silverberry for years and had enjoyed its sweet fragrance, but had never seen fruit on the bushes until one occasion when we were traveling down the Kootenai River Valley, in the beginning of September. Here all the plants were growing in great perfection, and in riding across a flat, through which a mountain stream meandered, we came across some superb silverberry bushes, which were higher than our horses’ heads and loaded with fruit. They were so beautiful that we carried a great bunch of them back to camp, tied to the pommel of the saddle. Since then we have learned that the berries are, in a sense, edible, though too dry and mealy to appeal to the taste of most people; and so the prairie chickens and other birds are allowed to enjoy them in peace, throughout their broad range from Quebec to Minnesota and Utah, and north to the Yukon.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the Kootenai River Valley, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.

"TWINLEAF

Jeffersonia diphylla (Linnaeus) Persoon

Jeffersonia, commonly called twinleaf, is one of the earliest of spring flowers. It blooms before the leaves are fully developed and is somewhat like a bloodroot in appearance. The long-stemmed leaf blades are parted nearly to the base, and as they are blown about by the wind, remind one of a group of green butterflies, though they lose this resemblance when fully developed, for they are then rather stiff. This plant, which was named for Thomas Jefferson, can be easily cultivated in a wildflower garden under the same conditions that will render the bloodroot happy.

Jeffersonia is most abundant west of the Appalachian Mountains, from Tennessee northward to Minnesota, Ontario, and central New York; locally, however, it has crossed the mountain barrier and pushed down the river valleys, notably along the Potomac River in Virginia and Maryland.

The sketch was made from a beautiful clump growing on Plummers Island in the Potomac River near Washington, District of Columbia.

"IVORY BANEBERRY

Actaea arguta Nuttall

Ivory baneberry is a white-fruited form of the red-fruited western baneberry, Actaea arguta. It prefers shady situations, near the borders of mountain streams, where the soil is rich and the air damp. The flowers, which have a sweet, sickish odor, appear in spring in racemes two inches long at the ends of the slender stems. The white petals and sepals soon fall, and the raceme lengthens. When the berries develop and become heavy, the stems bearing them appear almost too weak to carry the load, and the fruits soon drop when ripe. The berries are said to be poisonous, like the seeds of many other members of the Buttercup Family, to which the plant belongs.

Ivory baneberry is found from Utah and Colorado to Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was collected near Vermilion Pass on the motor road between Banff and the Columbia River Valley, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"PINK MOUNTAINHEATHER

Phyllodoce empetriformis (Smith) Don

The mountainheathers of the Canadian Rockies are an inspiration and a delight to those who climb to the higher places. They are found near tree line and on the bare slopes just above it, and cover the mountainsides with their deep green foliage. In blossom time they make a wonderful carpet of color—pink, red, and white. Among them all, the pink mountainheather is in many respects the most beautiful.

On Burgess Pass, seven miles by trail from Field, British Columbia, where this specimen was gathered at an altitude of 7,000 feet, the coloring was almost like that of an India shawl. The seed-pods are deep red and covered with golden dots of resin.

Pink mountainheather ranges from California to Colorado and northward to Alaska.

"ROCKY MOUNTAIN CASSIOPE

Cassiope mertensiana (Bongard) Don

With the exception of the rare orchids, the Rocky Mountain cassiope is perhaps the most romantic of American mountain flowers. It is found in perfection about tree line in the Canadian Rockies, which is usually at an altitude of 6,500 to 7,500 feet. Here, in favorable localities, it frequently forms dense, thick mats, and when in full bloom the plants are literally covered with delicate white bells. The tiny stems holding the blossoms may be either green or red, and when the flowers fall the seed capsules are usually red in color, becoming brown as the season advances. Growth in a single season is rather limited, and the stiff, woody stems underneath bear silent witness to the vicissitudes of plants at high altitudes. To the camper, a bed of cassiope is most satisfying, for in addition to its springiness it possesses an elusive fragrance that persists even when the plants are quite dried out. The red, pink, and white mountain heathers are frequently found growing with the cassiope, and add color to the wildflower carpet on the mountain sides.

Rocky Mountain cassiope is to be found from Montana to northern California and Alaska.

The specimen sketched was obtained at Burgess Pass near Field, British Columbia, Canada.

"ONE-LEAF BOG-ORCHID

Habenaria obtusata (Putrush) Richardson

This orchid is exceptional in having but a single basal leaf. The plant grows on the mossy banks of streams or in boggy places, delighting in the peaty soil, where other members of the genus Habenaria flourish. Its green color renders it inconspicuous and easily overlooked, especially when the larger, white, sweet-scented varieties are its near neighbors.

This species ranges from Maine, New York, and Colorado and northward to Newfoundland and Alaska.

This specimen was found at Hillsdale, eleven miles northwest of Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"BUSH CINQUEFOIL

Potentilla fruticosa Linnaeus

Bush cinquefoil is one of the showiest plants of the Canadian Rockies, where it seems to find congenial surroundings almost everywhere, flourishing in alpine meadows or on mountain slopes, and sometimes at high elevations, struggling against the mountain winds and other adverse conditions to obtain a foothold. In midsummer it is covered with clear yellow flowers, which appear to greater advantage by reason of the silver-gray foliage that forms their background. In moist limestone soils in New England it is classed as a weed, because of its invasion of idle fields and pastures.

This member of the Rose Family is found from California, New Mexico, and New Jersey northward to Alaska, central Canada, and Labrador, as well as in Europe and Asia.

The specimen sketched was collected on the trail below Burgess Pass, six miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"DOUGLAS HONEYSUCKLE

Lonicera glaucescens Rydberg

The Douglas honeysuckle is often found in the foothill valleys of the Canadian Rockies. In shade the flowers are orange, but they take a deeper hue of red or copper in situations more exposed to the sun. The leaves of the uppermost pair of each twig are expanded at the base and united to form a shallow cup, from which the flowers arise. The stiff, woody old branches from which the flowering stems grow are firmly intertwined with the branches of their supporting bush. When growing in the open, the vine forms a mass of twisted stems near the ground. The green leaves make an exquisite background for the flowers.

This plant ranges from Pennsylvania to Oklahoma and north to Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was collected in July, on the shores of Lake Minnewonka, ten miles from Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.

PLATE 81",DOUGLAS HONEYSUCKLE,Lonicera glaucescens Rydberg,"This plant ranges from Pennsylvania to Oklahoma and north to Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia.","The specimen sketched was collected in July, on the shores of Lake Minnewonka, ten miles from Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.",81,81,42667784,Alberta,Canada
"DOUGLAS HONEYSUCKLE

Lonicera glaucescens Rydberg

The bright red fruit of the Douglas honeysuckle ripens in September. At this season the leaves turn yellow, their veins being usually red. The juicy, inedible fruits are in clusters, each cluster surrounded by a leafy cup.

The range of this plant covers the central and northern portions of the United States, and southern Canada.

This sketch was made from a specimen found in September, in the upper Kootenay Valley near the motor road between the Columbia River Valley and Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.

"PINK TWISTEDSTALK

Streptopus curvipes Vail

In moist recesses of the woods in the Selkirk Mountains are found beds of pink twistedstalk. The bell-shaped, dainty, rose-colored flowers hang beneath the clear green leaves on slender stalks that spring from the leaf axils. Thus the passer-by does not see them, unless he knows where to search for the hidden flowers. The plant usually has unbranched stems and grows from a foot to two feet in height, forming extensive colonies in favorable places. It is a relative of the lily-of-the-valley of our gardens. The fruit is a round, red, inedible berry.

The species ranges from Oregon and British Columbia to Alaska.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Glacier House at Glacier Station in the Selkirk Mountains, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"CLASPING TWISTEDSTALK

Streptopus amplexifolius (Linnaeus) De Candolle

The clasping twistedstalk is similar in habit to the pink twistedstalk, but the flowers are greenish white. The whole plant is of greater size, often growing to a height of three feet, and the stems commonly are branched, except above tree line, where the plants are dwarfed by the cold. The berries of this species are also more conspicuous, oval in form and bright red in color, and freely produced along the stems. The stalks on which they are borne are twisted or sharply curved, hence the common name. The plant loves a moist rich soil in wooded places, where its lush growth and contrasting colors are attractive to the eye.

This member of the Lily-of-the-valley Family is found from the high mountains of North Carolina to New Mexico and northward to Greenland and Alaska. It occurs also in Europe and Asia.

The specimen sketched was found near Hector Station on the Canadian Pacific Railway, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"WHITE PEA

Lathyrus ochroleucus Hooker

The white pea is rank in growth when it finds a congenial situation, clambering over the undergrowth, and giving a delicate touch to the heavier shrubs by its graceful appearance and fresh color. Horses like it, especially when in bloom, or when the seed pods have formed. We found it in greatest perfection in July on the banks of Lake Minnetonka near Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,000 feet. The plants attach themselves for support to other objects in the same manner as the garden pea, by threadlike tendrils borne at the ends of the leaves.

White pea ranges from New Jersey westward to Wyoming, and northward to Quebec, Alberta, and British Columbia.

"MOUNTAIN JUNIPER

Juniperus sibirica Burgsdorf

Mountain juniper frequents dry, stony places either among other shrubs or on open mountain slopes, where it forms circular patches often ten feet in diameter, but seldom more than eighteen inches tall. Its many stiff branches and prickly leaves are so offensive that ponies, as well as people, avoid crossing the patches. By midsummer the bushes are loaded with blue-gray berry-like cones which, when winter comes, are eaten by wild birds. The berries of some of the other species of juniper were used by the Indians, who ate them either raw or dried, or ground into meal and prepared as mush or cakes. Cakes made from berries of alligator juniper, an Arizona species, are said to be easily digested and palatable to European people.

Mountain juniper ranges from Massachusetts, New York, and Michigan north to Labrador and central Canada, and in the Rocky Mountains from New Mexico to California and northward to Alaska. It occurs also in Siberia.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the Saskatchewan River Valley, British Columbia, fifty miles north of Lake Louise Station on the Canadian Pacific Railway, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"RIVERBANK GENTIAN

Gentiana affinis Grisebach

The riverbank gentian prefers the flat borders of streams in the lower valleys, where grasses and sedges find a combination of congenial soil and moisture. The purple flowers, with white markings on the petals, are elusive, since they are often hidden by neighboring plants. We found them near a “lick” where twenty mountain sheep, ewes and lambs, were enjoying the salty soil kept moist by the snow water from the rushing river nearby, which overflowed its banks each August afternoon.

The riverbank gentian, placed by some botanists in the genus Dasytephana, ranges from Colorado to California, and north to Saskatchewan and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was collected in the valley of the Red Deer River, three days by trail from Lake Louise Station on the Canadian Pacific Railway, Alberta, at an altitude of 5,500 feet.

"GRASSLEAF AGOSERIS

Agoseris graminifolia Greene

Grassleaf agoseris, although occurring in many places in the Canadian Rockies, is not often seen by travelers, for it usually grows amid a tangle of grass and other plants, and opens its flowers only in full sunlight. It has graceful leaves, and the fluffy seed heads, like those of dandelion, are more showy than the flowers. Some of the widely wind-blown seeds find suitable places for germination. Like other members of the Chicory Family, to which this plant belongs, its leaves and stems have a milky juice.

Grassleaf agoseris ranges from Arizona northward to the Canadian Rockies of Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was found by the shore of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 5,700 feet.

PLATE 88",GRASSLEAF AGOSERIS,Agoseris graminifolia Greene,Grassleaf agoseris ranges from Arizona northward to the Canadian Rockies of Alberta and British Columbia.,"The specimen sketched was found by the shore of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 5,700 feet.",88,88,42667777,Alberta,Canada
"SLENDER AGOSERIS

Agoseris gracilens (Gray) Kuntze

The fruiting heads of the various species of Agoseris are much more beautiful and showy than the flowers, which expand only in bright sunlight, and are often small and inconspicuous. In Alpine meadows the fluffy heads are very abundant. As the seeds ripen and are dislodged from the parent stem they are blown by the wind to favorable locations for germination.

This Agoseris may be found from Colorado northward to Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the Douglas Lake Valley, twenty-five miles by trail from Lake Louise Station, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

"SHOWY MILKWEED

Asclepias speciosa Torrey

We are so accustomed to seeing the eastern milkweeds scattered along the wayside or among the denizens of waste places, or in the case of the butterflyweed in isolated clumps, that it was a surprise to find a whole field of this beautiful milkweed in the Kootenay River Valley. It seemed to have exactly the right soil as well as other conditions suited to its needs, and the heavy, waxy, sweet-scented flowers were attracting many bees and butterflies to the feast of nectar spread for them. The plants were fully four feet tall. Most of the flowers were of a delicate shade of pink, although the fresher blossoms and buds were claret-colored, or almost maroon. When examined with a glass, the highly complicated structure of the flowers can be seen plainly.

This milkweed ranges from Kansas to California and north to Saskatchewan and British Columbia.

The specimen painted was found in the Columbia River Valley in British Columbia at Fairmount Hot Springs, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.

"NORTHERN LADYSLIPPER

Cypripedium passerinum Richardson

We had made numerous visits to the Canadian Rockies without having seen this beautiful ladyslipper, but one midsummer day, after fording a rushing mountain torrent, we came upon it suddenly. It was crowded among other plants, and seemed to prefer a moist situation with some sunshine. Elsewhere in the mountains we have since found it on the shores of lakes or streams, but usually in sheltered situations. In some places rich leaf mold encouraged more vigorous growth, and the plants were in clumps eighteen inches in height, with a profusion of the modest slipper-shaped flowers. The old seed pods of the previous season indicated nature’s prodigality in providing abundant seeds.

This orchid is distributed from Ontario to Alberta and British Columbia and northward to Alaska.

The specimen sketched grew at Healy Creek, near Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,700 feet.

"SMALL YELLOW LADYSLIPPER

Cypripedium parviflorum Salisbury

The flowers of the small yellow ladyslipper, their golden pouches decked with streamers of bronze and claret, immediately attract us by their beauty, and we do not wonder that passing bees are enticed by the coloring and perfume of the flowers. Inside the yellow pouch are numerous fine hairs, which secrete tiny drops of a sticky fluid. The bee, attempting to escape, after she has been smeared with this substance, is forced by the shape of the pouch to crawl out by one of the narrow passages, on the sides of which the pollen masses and stigma are placed. In so doing the bee brushes first past the stigma and then the pollen-bearing anthers. She cannot leave pollen on a stigma until she has been smeared with pollen from another flower, and thus cross fertilization is effected.

Fortunately, this orchid is easily grown in a wild garden, requiring only a plentiful supply of humus in the soil.

The specimen sketched was found in North Carolina, but the plant ranges from Georgia to Newfoundland and westward to Missouri, Utah, and British Columbia.

"RAYLESS GROUNDSEL

Senecio pauciflorus Pursh

Rayless groundsel, though not usually conspicuous, gives in mid-summer a touch of brilliant color amid the otherwise dull grasses and willows of the mountain meadows. At first sight it seems to be a budding flower, soon to unfold, but the long rays characteristic of most other species of composites are absent, and the head expands no further.

Rayless groundsel extends from Michigan to Wyoming and California, and northward to Labrador, Quebec, and Alaska.

The specimen sketched grew in the valley of Johnson Creek, twelve miles northeast of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5250 feet.

"NAIAD SPRINGBEAUTY

Claytonia parvifolia Macfarlane

As we pick our way along some of the wet, stony trails near Glacier House, British Columbia, we find, if observing closely, the dainty stems of the naiad springbeauty, a member of the Purslane Family, growing from a small rosette of green leaves. This frail and delicate plant thrives in the cool drippings from the rocky banks. It is especially interesting from the fact that it propagates freely by bulblets from the axils of the stem leaves.

This plant ranges from Alaska southward in the mountains to California and Montana.

The specimen sketched was found near Glacier House in the Selkirk Mountains of British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"AMERICAN PASQUEFLOWER

Pulsatilla ludoviciana (Nuttall) Heller

The pasqueflower is one of the loveliest of the anemones. It is known commonly in the Canadian Rockies as “wild crocus.” In early spring the stalks push through the ground as soon as the snow disappears, and flower before the leaves unfold. In dry regions, like the upper valley of the Columbia River in British Columbia, there sometimes follows a second period of blooming, when rain comes in late summer after a dry season, but these summer flowers are inferior in size and beauty to those of spring.

The pasqueflower is really a prairie plant. It is found from Michigan and Illinois to Texas, Washington, and Alaska. It has been selected as the State flower of South Dakota.

The sketch was made from a specimen gathered in July near the summit of Sulphur Mountain at Banff, Alberta, Canada, at 8,000 feet elevation.

"AMERICAN PASQUEFLOWER

Pulsatilla ludoviciana (Nuttall) Heller

The hairy basal leaves of the pasqueflower, growing directly from the root, and also a whorl of stem leaves, borne at the middle of the flower stalk, develop quickly after the flowers have faded. The seeds, each provided with a curved silky tail, remain attached to the head until ripe, when they are scattered by the winds.

The pasqueflower ranges throughout the prairie and Rocky Mountain States and the provinces of western Canada.

The specimen sketched was obtained in midsummer at Ghost River, twenty-five miles from Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.

"SWEETVETCH

Hedysarum mackenziei Richardson

In but one place that we visited in the Canadian Rockies did we find sweetvetch growing in perfection. For several seasons we have made “Wild Flower Camp” our headquarters for a short time. On the trail passing from that place up the steep slopes to the divide above the head of Johnson Creek, we came to a deep unnamed alpine lake, along whose rocky shore the trail leads. On the slopes above the trail, where the glaciers have plowed away the mountainside, leaving stretches of upland meadows between the rocks, the disintegrating limestone provides ideal soil conditions for leguminous plants. Here sweetvetch grows in clumps, with stems stiff enough to support the heavy blossoms, while the luxuriant growth of leaves forms a fine background for the flowers. These are of various shades of crimson and pink, or occasionally pure white, and their scent is as delightful as that of freshly gathered sweet peas from the home garden. In other localities the flower heads are so heavy that the stems lie prostrate on the ground, making beautiful rosettes sometimes eighteen inches across. Alexander Mackenzie, in his journey of discovery down the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean in 1793, used the roots of sweetvetch as an emergency food.

This plant is restricted to the Canadian Rocky Mountain region, from Alberta to Northwest Territory and Yukon.

The unnamed lake is about ten miles northeast of Lake Louise Station, Alberta, Canada, but by the circuitous trail one and a half days are required. The altitude is about 8,000 feet.

"MISTMAIDEN

Romanzoffia sitchensis Bongard

Mistmaiden is a dainty alpine plant that is found at or above tree line almost anywhere in the northern Rockies, if growth conditions are favorable. It grows frequently in rock crevices, and delights in moist spots where water from melting snow seeps through the earth or drips from the rocks above. During the short growing season it is able to endure the freezing temperatures that are frequent at night. It is but rarely that the delicate stems and fragile flowers are injured or destroyed. The first specimen that we found was carried to camp and placed in water in a tin outside the tent. In the morning, to our dismay, the water was a solid block of ice, and we thought the beautiful specimen was ruined; but when the ice melted the plant was as fresh as ever.

This interesting member of the Waterleaf Family ranges from Montana to northern California and Alaska. As its specific name, sitchensis, indicates, the plant was collected first at Sitka, Alaska.

The specimen sketched grew near Lake O'Hara in the Canadian Rockies, British Columbia, at an altitude of 6,600 feet.

"COLUMBIA CLEMATIS

Clematis columbiana (Nuttall) Torrey and Gray

Columbia clematis is one of the daintiest and most attractive of the mountain wild flowers. The scrambling vine grows gracefully over the rocks, or clings to some convenient support of bushes or small trees, the single purple blossoms lending themselves to the situation with the utmost freedom from conventionality. The stems are woody, and after the petal-like sepals fall the feathery seed heads are quite as attractive as the flowers. The blossoms are produced in spring or early summer.

Columbia clematis may be found from the mountains of Colorado and Washington northward to the Canadian Rockies in Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched grew five miles from Field, British Columbia, on the slopes of Mount Burgess, near the trail to Burgess Pass, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

"COLUMBIA CLEMATIS

Clematis columbiana (Nuttall Torrey and Gray)

The fruits of the Columbia clematis, although not so conspicuous as the flowers, are quite as beautiful. The silky tails attached to the “seeds” of the loose heads become feather-like as they ripen. The soft shades of green grow paler and finally turn silvery gray, when the ripe fruits are loosened from the parent stem and carried away by the wind.

Columbia clematis extends from Utah and Colorado northward to Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was found in August in the Horse Thief Valley, Selkirk Mountains, British Columbia, twenty miles west of Athelmere, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"LODGEPOLE PINE

Pinus contorta murrayana (Balfour) Engelmann

Lodgepole pine is the commonest tree of the Canadian Rockies. In places where fire has taken toll of the primeval forest it is usually the first forest growth to obtain a foothold. Here it frequently grows in thickets so dense that they are almost impenetrable for animals after the trees have reached a height of seven or eight feet. When full grown the lodgepole pine attains a height of eighty feet, with a trunk one to three feet in diameter. If the trees stand alone their branches persist nearly to the base of the trunk. The tree is the one most easily available for tent or tepee poles, hence its common name. A striking feature of the tree is that the cones remain upon the branches for a long time, often for years after the tree is dead. The wood is light yellow or nearly white, soft and weak, and is little used for lumber. The Indians, in times of scarcity of other food, sometimes ate the inner bark and soft sapwood.

Lodgepole pine ranges from Colorado and California northward to Saskatchewan and Alaska.

The specimen sketched was procured on the North Fork of the Saskatchewan River, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"LANCELEAF PAINTBRUSH

Castilleja lancifolia Rydberg

The habit of the lanceleaf paintbrush is quite different from that of many other members of the genus Castilleja, as it has a long creeping, perennial rootstock. Usually, it is found in moist woods on the lower levels of the eastern slopes of the Rockies. Being protected by sheltering trees and herbs from the sharp frosts that often come in mid-August, it is one of the last flowers to be found in full bloom. The vivid red of the bracts surrounding the flowers, which form dense spikes at the ends of the stiff stems, is especially noticeable to one traveling the mountain trails at this season. In burnt-timber areas it is likely to have survived the ravages of fire, since the rootstock is protected from the heat by the soil above.

This striking member of the Figwort Family ranges from Colorado and Utah north to Alberta and Alaska.

The specimen sketched was found in the valley of the Pipestone River, fifteen miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 5,500 feet.

"WHITE THISTLE

Cirsium hookerianum Nuttall

White thistles grow luxuriantly in the northern Rocky Mountains. Their seeds, readily blown about by the wind, embrace every opportunity to obtain a foothold. Along the motor road between Banff and Lake Louise, they grow in great perfection, often four feet tall, with numerous flower heads along the straight stem, commonly culminating in a rosette of many heads at the apex. The tender opening flowerets are much relished by the ponies, who do not seem to mind the prickly bracts and leaves. Above tree line, the plants are reduced in size, often flowering when only six inches high.

The white thistle is distributed from Montana northward to the Canadian Rockies in Alberta and British Columbia.

Our specimen grew near the summit of Vermilion Pass, Alberta, on the motor road between Castle Station, on the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the Columbia River Valley, at an altitude of 5,400 feet.

"GRAY PUSSYTOES

Antennaria howellii Greene

When the showy flowers of spring abound, we naturally overlook the less conspicuous plants, but as the season advances attention is attracted to them. It is then that we notice the gray pussytoes growing on flats along stream beds, where the waters from melting glaciers have deposited some of their load of mud and sand. These flats support a luxuriant growth of coarse grasses, sedges, and willows. In midsummer they are overflowed in the afternoon of every warm day, and the soil is always moist. In such situations this plant thrives, often forming extensive colonies, which are propagated by prostrate leafy shoots that take root and form new plants. The “seeds,” also, are provided with a tuft of silky hairs, so that they are easily carried to great distances by the wind.

The range of this relative of the daisies is from Montana to Washington, and north to Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched grew at Lone Tree Camp on the Siffleur River, fifty miles north of Lake Louise Station, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"CALYPSO

Cytherea bulbosa (Linnaeus) House

In mountain woods, where pine needles cover the ground and preserve the moisture underneath, the dainty calypso is often found and is a joy to recall ever after. This lovely little orchid, waving with each passing breath of wind, is poised on a slender stem that seems too delicate to support its weight. The tiny bulb, barely half an inch thick, is much valued by the Indians of Alberta in spring as a delicious morsel, comparable to new potatoes.

Calypso is a cool-climate plant and occurs chiefly in the far north, or at high altitudes southward. It apparently survived the glacial period in the southern Rocky Mountains, in Arizona and New Mexico. Since the ice retreated it has been able to push northward as far as Labrador and Alaska. It is still found in the eastern United States in northern New York, Vermont, and Maine.

The specimen sketched was found in Glacier National Park, Montana.

"ROCK WILLOW

Salix petrophila Rydberg

This diminutive willow occurs on mountain slopes where other species of willow also flourish, but grows only four or five inches tall, and has the appearance rather of an herb than of a shrub. As soon as the overlying blanket of snow melts, the stems come to life. When the catkins are fully developed, the whole plant is very lovely, and attracts many small bees and other insects. The pollen falls in a golden shower when the branches are shaken. The pistillate flowers develop rapidly into silky heads during the long days of sunshine in June and July. The silk-tipped seeds, loosening from the split pods, are then blown by the wind to a new location.

Rock willow occurs on alpine peaks from New Mexico to California and north to British Columbia and Mackenzie.

The specimen sketched was found on the slopes of Mt. Wapta near Burgess Pass, seven miles by trail from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

"SWEET ANDROSACE

Androsace carinata Tottey

Sweet androsace is really a spring flower, unfolding on the lower hillsides with the earliest blossoms, but it may be found during most of the summer by ascending to a higher altitude. Its sweet odor and the dainty clustered flowers, with their yellow centers, lend the plant a peculiar charm. The rosettes of stiff green leaves, from which each delicate flower stem rises, give a mosslike appearance to a colony of the plants. They frequent both dry and moist situations. Several related species occur frequently in the northern Rockies, but they are of unattractive appearance, and are seldom noticed.

This member of the Primrose Family ranges from the cold mountain tops of New Mexico north to Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was found at Ptarmigan Pass, seven miles northeast of Lake Louise, British Columbia, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.

PLATE 107",SWEET ANDROSACE,Androsace carinata Tottey,This member of the Primrose Family ranges from the cold mountain tops of New Mexico north to Alberta and British Columbia.,"The specimen sketched was found at Ptarmigan Pass, seven miles northeast of Lake Louise, British Columbia, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.",107,107,42667758,British Columbia,Canada
"BLUEGREEN GENTIAN

Gentiana glauca Pallas

Several species of gentian are common in the Canadian Rockies, but the bluegreen gentian is a most elusive plant. I have found it only in the region of Ptarmigan Pass, where it is extremely local, inhabiting northern slopes, near the borders of alpine lakes. Following a trail that the horses had made in order to reach the higher meadows, where the sweet short grass was plentiful, we found the shy beauty. The plants grow singly or in clumps with three or four clusters of bluegreen flowers. The pale leaves form a rosette about the base of each blooming stem. The flowers are a peculiar shade of blue-green. They resemble closed gentians more than other members of the family found in the region, since the small pointed petals do not fully expand even with full sunshine. Blooming in August in the exposed situations that they prefer, above tree line, the plants are often caught by the early frosts, and thus are prevented frequently from ripening seeds.

The bluegreen gentian, sometimes placed in the genus Dasystepana, is found from Montana to British Columbia and Alaska, and also in Siberia.

The specimen sketched grew near a small lake eight miles by trail northeast of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.

"ROCKY MOUNTAIN TWAYBLADE

Ophrys nephrophylla Rydberg

Rocky Mountain twayblade is one of the most common representatives of the Orchid Family in the Canadian Rockies. It delights in the recesses of damp woods, and grows among mosses and other moisture-loving plants, where the sunshine filters but faintly through the trees. The flowers vary in color from yellowish green to green or purple. The plants are so small and so nearly uniform in color that they are easily overlooked among other vegetation. Such unobtrusive plants as these show little affinity in their general appearance with their more showy relatives, such as the ladyslippers and the brilliant exotic orchids of our hothouses.

This twayblade is a mountain species, and ranges from New Mexico northwestward to Montana and Alaska. A closely related species is found from New Jersey to central Canada and Labrador.

The sketch was made from specimens collected at Yoho Pass, eleven miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,900 feet.

"SPOTTED SAXIFRAGE

Saxifraga bronchialis Linnaeus

Spotted saxifrage grows most plentifully about tree line. It grows in masses over the rocks, in whose crevices its roots find a foothold. The Latin specific name is derived from saxum, a rock, and frango, I break. The dark green foliage retains its color through the winter, and gives to the beds of the plant a mosslike appearance. The flowers are visited by great numbers of bees and flies. Sometimes the spots on the petals are green or yellow instead of red, the other characters of the plant remaining the same. In nature's rock gardens these hardy plants, wherever they grow, lend grace and beauty to the scene.

This saxifrage (which has also been called Leptasea austromontana) is found from Utah and New Mexico northward to Alberta and British Columbia and Alaska. It grows also in northern Asia and Europe.

The specimen sketched was collected near Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,500.

"BEARBERRY

Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (Linnaeus) Sprengel

This shrubby member of the Heath Family is seldom seen in bloom by the traveler. Early in the season, soon after the snow melts, the flowers may be found hidden under the mass of beautiful evergreen leaves. They prefer a dry, gravelly, or sandy soil. The leaves were used by the Indians either in combination with tobacco, or by themselves, for smoking purposes. The plant has also been used in medicine as an astringent, as well as by tanners in making leather.

Bearberry, or kinnikinnick, may be found from New Jersey to New Mexico and California, and northward to Labrador and Alaska.

The sketch was made from a specimen secured near Mount Assiniboine, fifty miles south of Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"BEARBERRY

Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (Linnaeus) Sprengel

FRUIT OF PLATE III

When August comes, the green fruits of the bearberry, or kinnikinnick, begin to appear, and soon turn a bright red. Then the plant assumes a more interesting appearance, and if a sufficient amount of moisture is available the berries are numerous and well developed. Grouse and other birds are glad to add these berries to their scanty winter menu, even though they taste to us dry and insipid.

Bearberry, which belongs to the Heath Family, may be found from New Jersey to New Mexico and California, and northward to Labrador and Alaska.

The specimen sketched was collected near Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.

"GREEN PYROLA

Pyrola chlorantha Swartz

The green pyrola is a denizen of dry wooded slopes, and blossoms in July. Although it has fewer flowers than the pink species, it is almost as attractive. The slightly sweet-scented flowers are borne on a stiff stem, rising from a rosette of leathery, evergreen leaves. The flowers are thick and fleshy and remain for a long time upon the plant, being followed by dry seed pods.

Green pyrola has a wide range, extending from Virginia to Arizona and California, and northward to Labrador and British Columbia. It occurs also in Europe.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the valley of the Siffleur River, fifty miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"AVALANCHE BUTTERCUP

Ranunculus suksdorfi Gray

On the high slopes of the mountains, close to the melting snow banks, the avalanche buttercups grow, frequently associated with anemones, and contrasting their golden cups with the white anemone flowers. As the season advances, we find the buttercups only near the old snow of the avalanches, where the cold has delayed the unfolding of the buds. Warm days soon destroy the beauty of the flowers.

The avalanche buttercup ranges from Montana and Washington to Alberta and British Columbia.

Our sketch was made from a specimen collected on the slopes of Mt. Field near Burgess Pass, seven miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

"CANADA BUFFALOBERRY

Lepargyrea canadensis (Linnaeus) Greene

Canada buffaloberry is an inconspicuous shrub until the berries ripen, when it decorates the mountain slopes with its red or sometimes yellow berries. These are bitter in flavor, though useful to quench thirst, and were used by the Indians as a tonic. When the berries are mashed and water is added, they make a frothy mass when beaten, which some persons enjoy. Sometimes the name quassia is given locally to the plant. Horses like the twigs as a change from the grass and other green things that they eat on the trail. The flowers, produced in spring on the leafless branches, are small and greenish yellow. The leaves, which come later, are covered beneath with silver scales that are beautiful when viewed through a lens.

Canada buffaloberries may be found in the mountains from New York to New Mexico and Oregon, and northward to Newfoundland and Alaska.

Our specimen was collected near Hector Station, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"DEATHCAMAS

Zygadenus elegans Pursh

In nature's flower gardens in the Canadian Rockies we find in July quantities of this elegant plant. The bunch of pale, grasslike leaves is surmounted by several stems on which are carried a number of greenish white flowers with a bright green gland at the base of each petal. They sway in the breezes, and make a lovely group with wild peas, columbines, asters, and other mountain flowers. They are free from the limitations of many mountain plants, since all kinds of slopes, exposures, and soils seem satisfactory for their growth, though the finest specimens we ever found were growing out of calcareous tufa. The horses know the plant well, and are never deceived into eating its poisonous leaves, though these appear much like grass when the plant is out of bloom.

This species of deathcamas has a wide range, growing in suitable situations, in the mountains of Nevada and New Mexico and northward to North Dakota and Alaska.

The specimen sketched was obtained on the Clearwater River, thirty-five miles by trail north of Lake Louise Station, British Columbia, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

"SASKATOON

Amelanchier alnifolia Nuttall

The saskatoon, service-berry, or June-berry, a northwestern species of shadblow, belongs to the Apple Family, and is usually a bush six to eight feet high, though when growing among other bushes it sometimes attains a height of ten or fifteen feet. The fruits are borne in heavy clusters, and when partly ripe are bright red, turning to purple when fully ripe. They resemble huckleberries in appearance, but are disappointing in flavor, especially when cooked. They may easily be gathered from horseback, and after a long ride are very refreshing. The Indians ate them fresh from the bushes, and also dried them for winter. In Lewis and Clark's journal, they are mentioned as being pounded into a pulp by the Indians, formed into loaves, and dried. These would keep sweet for the season and when needed, portions were broken off and cooked in stews. Birds and bears also enjoy these berries.

The saskatoon occurs in dry soil from Michigan to Nebraska and Colorado and northward to western Ontario, British Columbia, and the Yukon.

The specimen sketched was obtained near the Horse Thief River, one of the sources of the Columbia River in British Columbia, twenty miles northwest of Athelmerte, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.

"PRAIRIE ASTER

Aster campestris Nuttall

In one of our saddle journeys in the Columbia River Valley in British Columbia, the waning season for flowers brought to our notice this beautiful aster. It seemed to ignore the dry soil conditions, and expanded its bright purple flowers in many exposed situations where other plants had gone to seed. The slender stems are very brittle; the narrow leaves are usually entire, though sometimes toothed.

The prairie aster ranges along the Rocky Mountains from Colorado to Oregon and northward to Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched grew near Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.

"OWL-CLOVER

Orthocarpus tenuifolius Bentham

Going south from Canal Flats along the valley of the Kootenay River, we soon leave the higher mountains and heavily timbered country, the motor road crossing many small, dry prairies. Here the owl-clover is in full bloom in midsummer, forming great patches of pink color among the grasses. This plant is not related to the clovers, but belongs to the Figwort Family. Its manner of growth is different from that of the related paintbrushes, yet it recalls them in many ways. As in them, the bright color is exhibited by bracts rather than flowers.

The valley of the Kootenay River runs north and south, and like the Columbia River Valley, of which it is a continuation, is variable in soil and climate. Protected by mountains on either side, with climatic conditions directly the result of the proximity of the mountains, its rich, light soil deposited by glacial streams, the valley requires only irrigation to cause it to produce bountifully. But, lacking moisture, the plants that flourish in the valley are arid-soil plants or those which lie comparatively dormant until showers waken them to life.

Owl-clover ranges from Idaho and Washington to British Columbia.

The specimen sketched grew near Cranbrook, British Columbia.

"SHOWY OXYTROPE

Oxytropis splendens Douglas

Showy oxytrope is one of the most attractive members of the Pea Family. The graceful stems hold the flower spikes well above the silky leaves, which form a tufted mass about the roots. The gray-green leaves contrast pleasingly with the purple flowers. Some authors use the genus name Aragallus instead of Oxytropis. Though this is properly a prairie plant, it is found frequently in the lower valleys on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.

Showy oxytrope ranges from Minnesota to Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and Yukon.

The specimen sketched was gathered in the Bow Valley, fifteen miles west of Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"ALPINE FERNLEAF

Pedicularis contorta Bentham

Alpine fernleaf is locally plentiful in the Canadian Rockies, but it seems particular in the choice of a situation where favorable conditions combine to give it both soil and exposure to its liking. It is often found on loose, steep soils above timberline. It grows in clumps, several flowering stems frequently a foot tall being produced from a central root. The leaves may be green or red, and the flowers either pure white or delicately shaded.

Alpine fernleaf occurs in the high mountains of Montana and California, extending northward to Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched grew on the slope of Mount St. Piran near Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

"PUSSY WILLOW

Salix discolor Muhlenberg

Pussy willows possess a certain fascination when we gather them with their tight winter buds, early in spring, in their wild haunts, and watch them expand in the warmer air of the house into fluffy catkins. Out of doors they attract many bees to the early feast of pollen spread for them. The catkins are of two kinds, borne on separate plants; those which bear only flowers with stamens, and the fertile ones which produce later in the season myriads of silk-appendaged seeds.

Pussy willow grows in swamps and on moist hillsides from Delaware to North Carolina and Missouri, and northward to Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan.

The sketch was made from a specimen collected near Washington, District of Columbia.

"BLOODROOT

Sanguinaria canadensis Linnaeus

Bloodroot is such an ephemeral flower that we must visit the woods at exactly the right time in early spring to see it in perfection. The warm sun brings it into beautiful bloom, and we find its colonies in rich moist woods. It has pushed through the covering of brown autumn leaves that have protected it through the winter. Like other members of the Poppy Family, it has an acrid juice. This is blood-red in color, staining anything that it touches. The Indians used it as a paint, while the white man's children gather the roots and use them to color Easter eggs a soft brown hue.

Bloodroot ranges from Florida, Alabama, and Arkansas northward to Nova Scotia and Manitoba.

The sketch was made from a specimen gathered in Washington, District of Columbia.

"PYXIE

Pyxidanthera barbulata Michaux

The thrill of finding pyxie in the early spring is equaled only by the sensation of first discovering trailing-arbutus. This mosslike plant is classed by botanists as an evergreen shrub, though in its creeping habit it does not seem a shrub at all. It is one of the few American representatives of the Diapensia Family, which is related to the heaths. The flowers are sessile and pure white, and nestle among the leaves, which are often dark red. It is sometimes grown in rock gardens, planted in a mixture of acid peat and clean sand, and thrives in either moist or dry situations.

Pyxie is found in dry, sandy pine barrens from North Carolina to southern New Jersey.

The specimen sketched came from Whitesbog, New Jersey.

"HEPATICA

Hepatica americana Ker

“There are many things left for May,” writes John Burroughs, “but nothing fairer, if as fair, as the first flower, the hepatica. I find I have never admired this little firstling half enough. When at the maturity of its charms it is certainly the gem of the woods.” With the first warm days of spring the soft woolly buds spring from the heart of the plant, where they were formed in the autumn. The hardy blooms make their first appearance on southern slopes in the woods. Often they are half hidden by the leaves, which persist from the previous season. The flowers vary in color from pale blue to white and pink, and often have an alluring odor, though this characteristic varies in different plants. The new leaves develop as soon as the flowers fall.

Hepatica is found from northern Florida to Missouri and northward to Nova Scotia and Manitoba. A closely related species grows in Europe and Asia.

The specimen sketched grew in Washington, District of Columbia.

"TRAILING-ARBUTUS

Epigaea repens Linnaeus

Trailing-arbutus is an evergreen plant, belonging to the Heath Family, and occurs in rocky or sandy woods, especially under evergreen trees. The flowering buds are formed before the arrival of the cold of winter, and open with the first sunny days of spring. Hidden away under dead leaves, and frequently with their pearly flowers turned toward the earth, they are not discovered by the casual passer-by.

It is frequently called mayflower in New England, and is the State flower of Massachusetts. Bryant associates it with the earliest spring flowers in his poem “The twenty-seventh of March.”

...within the woods
Tufts of ground laurel, creeping underneath
The leaves of the last summer, send their sweets
Up to the chilly air
while Whittier tells us of

Sad Mayflower, watched by winter stars,
And nursed by winter gales

With petals of the sleeted spars
And leaves of frozen sails!

But warmer suns ere long shall bring
To life the frozen sod,
And through dead leaves of hope shall spring
afresh the flowers of God.

Trailing-arbutus, when furnished with proper acid soil and suitable exposure, can be grown readily, and produces a fleshy, edible fruit. The specimen sketched was found in Washington, District of Columbia, but the plant ranges from Florida, Kentucky, and Wisconsin northwest to Newfoundland and Saskatchewan.

"CANADA WILDGINGER

Asarum canadense Linnaeus

Canada wildginger is one of our earliest spring flowers. Owing to its habit of growth, the flowers, hidden by dead leaves of the preceding autumn, are easily overlooked. The rootstocks have the pungent flavor of ginger, but the juice of the leaves and stems is bitter. Lying so close to the ground, and thus sheltered from the winds, the flowers are a refuge for small flies which serve to pollinate them.

Canada wildginger prefers rich woods, and ranges from North Carolina to Missouri and Kansas, and northward to New Brunswick and Manitoba.

The sketch was made from a plant that grew on Plummers Island, in the Potomac River, near Washington, District of Columbia.

"PINXTERBLOOM

Azalea nudiflora Linnaeus

In early spring, the bare stems of the pinxterbloom, or wild azalea with their clusters of curved red buds, are conspicuous in the woods or along the banks of the brimful streams. As the flowers open, exhaling their peculiar faint perfume, they are visited by bumblebees and moths. The leaves begin to open about the same time as the flowers, but they do not expand fully until the blooming period has passed.

Easily yielding to cultivation, if the soil is acid, either sunny or shady places may be utilized to grow the plants. They will flourish also in either dry or swampy situations, growing to a height of six feet in suitable soil.

This species of pinxterbloom ranges from North Carolina northward, and since the ice sheets of the glacial period retreated, it has pushed a short distance into the glaciated territory, to a line extending from Illinois through central New York to Massachusetts. A closely related species occurs still farther north.

The specimen sketched was collected near Washington, District of Columbia.

"WILD CALLA

Calla palustris Linnaeus

Calla is an ancient name taken from Pliny. Our wild plant, the only species of the genus, belongs to the same family as the showy greenhouse plant, to which the name calla is applied commonly. Growing in bogs, and along the borders of sluggish streams, the bright green leaves of the wild calla mingle with those of other bog plants, and not until the plant comes into bloom, and the white spathe appears, are we attracted to it. Large numbers of small flies and midges visit the flowers.

Wild calla is a member of the Arum Family, a vast group, most of whose representatives are inhabitants of tropical forests. It should be noted that in the case of our plant, as in other members of the family, what appears to be a blossom is really a spike of many small and inconspicuous flowers, surrounded by a showy corm-like envelope or spathe.

Wild calla ranges from New Jersey to Iowa and Wisconsin, and northward to Nova Scotia, Hudson Bay, and Alaska. It occurs also in Europe and Asia.

The specimen sketched was obtained west of Sudbury on the Canadian Pacific Railway in Canada.

"CHICKASAW PLUM

Prunus angustifolia Marshall

The Chickasaw plum is one of the first woody plants to bloom in the spring. It is really a small tree, in favorable situations growing to a height of twenty-five feet, with a trunk eight inches in diameter. It is very feathery and attractive when in bloom, though the petals soon fall. The fruit is bright red, rarely yellow, and is appreciated by wild birds. The Indians used it as food, and it can be made into jellies and jams of fine flavor.

"GRASS-PINK ORCHID

Limodorum tuberosum Linnaeus

Grass-pink orchid is to be looked for in bogs and meadows, in June or July. It is one of five species of the genus occurring in the eastern United States, Cuba, and the Bahamas. This member of the Orchid Family is often plentiful in peat bogs, where it is associated with those pogonia, or other acid-loving plants. The peculiar arrangement of the flower parts, with the crested lip at the top, gives the impression that the blossoms are placed upside down upon the plant, but actually it is the other orchids with their pendent lips which are reversed. The name Limodorum, given by Linnaeus, is derived from the Greek and may be translated as “meadow gift.” Some botanists use for this plant the genus name Calopogon, which means “beautiful beard.”

This orchid is distributed from Florida to Missouri and northward to Minnesota, Ontario, and Newfoundland.

The specimen sketched grew near Tuckerton, New Jersey.

"DEERBERRY

Polycodium stamineum (Linnaeus) Greene

Deerberry is a bushy shrub which often is found growing with pinxterbloom and other heaths, and thrives under similar conditions of soil and exposure. When flowering branches are detached, they present a feathery appearance, but on the bush itself the numerous bell-shaped flowers, which hang below the stems, are often obscured by the profuse, pale foliage. Deerberry is referred by many botanists to the genus Vaccinium, which contains the blueberries and whortleberries. Its globular fruit, green or greenish-yellow at maturity and often more than half an inch in diameter, is seldom eaten. It is sometimes called squaw huckleberry. In the Southern States, the species of Polycodium are called, erroneously, 'gooseberry,' and the fruit of a species with purple berries is very commonly eaten.

Deerberry has a wide distribution, being found from Florida to Louisiana, and northward to New England and Minnesota.

The specimen sketched grew at Washington, District of Columbia.

"BOG KALMIA

Kalmia polifolia Wangenheim

Bog kalmia is a handsome member of the Heath Family, though never so showy as Kalmia latifolia, the mountain-laurel of our hillsides and woods. Growing in sphagnum bogs, it is a shrub two feet or less in height, with thick, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the winter. The flowers are attractive to bees, but the leaves, like those of other Kalmias, are poisonous to stock. The fruit is a small, dry capsule. This species is easily distinguished from lambkill, Kalmia angustifolia, with which it is sometimes confused, by the insertion of the flowers at the naked tip of the stem, rather than among the leaves.

Bog kalmia ranges from northern New Jersey and Pennsylvania to Michigan, and northward to Alaska, Hudson Bay, and Newfoundland.

The specimen sketched was cultivated in the greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture at Washington, District of Columbia.

"PAINTED TRILLIUM

Trillium undulatum Willdenow

The painted trillium is one of the loveliest of the genus, differing from other species in having its soft petals decorated with lines of pink or wine color. In May and June it may be found in cold, moist woods in acid soil, where it delights in partial sunlight, before the foliage matures on the trees. The fleshy fruits are bright red.

Painted trillium occurs from Georgia and Missouri northward to Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Wisconsin.

The specimen sketched was obtained from eastern Massachusetts.

PLATE 134",PAINTED TRILLIUM,Trillium undulatum Willdenow,"Painted trillium occurs from Georgia and Missouri northward to Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Wisconsin.",The specimen sketched was obtained from eastern Massachusetts.,134,134,42667727,Massachusetts,USA
"FRINGED POLYGALA

Polygala paucifolia Willdenow

Fringed polygala differs widely from many other members of its genus in that the flowers are borne singly instead of in cloverlike heads or racemes. Its lovely color and the dainty fringes on the central petal also differentiate it from other members of the group. It is a plant of acid soils.

Fringed polygala extends from Georgia, Illinois, and Minnesota northward to Anticosti, New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Pocono Manor, Pennsylvania.

"SQUIRRELCORN

Bikukulla canadensis (Goldie) Millspaugh

Squirreledcorn is found in rich woods in spring, its beautiful, slightly scented flowers borne on a dainty stem well above the pale, feathery leaves. The curious rootstock is very distinctive, bearing many small, yellow tubers that resemble grains of corn. The leaves wither soon after the seeds have matured, in early summer. The plant belongs to the Fumitory Family, and is a near relative of dutchman's breeches and the bleeding heart of gardens. Some writers prefer to use for the genus the name Dicentra.

Squirreledcorn ranges from Virginia to Tennessee and Missouri, and northward to Nebraska, Ontario, and Nova Scotia.

The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"RED MAPLE

Acer rubrum Linnaeus

Red maple is our most showy tree of early spring. Its buds begin to develop with the first sunny days and the tree is soon covered with bloom. In autumn it is equally conspicuous, when its leaves, after the early frosts, turn a brilliant red. The red maple loves swamps and low grounds, and often borders woodlands. The tree is usually small or of medium size, but is reported, under exceptionally favorable conditions, to attain a height of 120 feet. The bark of old trees is rough and dark, but on young trees, smooth and gray. The light brown wood is used in the manufacture of furniture and of small turned articles.

Red maple ranges from Florida to Texas and northward to Nebraska, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia.

The specimen sketched was found at Spring Lake, New Jersey.

PLATE 137",RED MAPLE,Acer rubrum Linnaeus,"Red maple ranges from Florida to Texas and northward to Nebraska, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia.","The specimen sketched was found at Spring Lake, New Jersey.",137,137,42667730,New Jersey,USA
"CAROLINA MAPLE

Acer carolinianum Walter

Carolina maple is closely related to the red maple, but it is often a smaller tree. The bark is smooth and gray and the wood light brown in color. The small, red flowers appear with the first days of spring, but the tree is at its best when the fruit develops, and the branches are covered with crimson “keys” which contrast strikingly with the bare branches of other nearby trees. Like its relative, the red maple, it prefers wet or moist soil, and often abounds in coastal swamps.

Carolina maple is distributed from Florida to Texas and northward to Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and has been reported also from Massachusetts.

The specimen sketched was obtained at Beaufort, South Carolina.

PLATE 138",CAROLINA MAPLE,Acer carolinianum Walter,"Carolina maple is distributed from Florida to Texas and northward to Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and has been reported also from Massachusetts.","The specimen sketched was obtained at Beaufort, South Carolina.",138,138,42667731,South Carolina,USA
"LONGLEAF PINE

Pinus palustris Miller

A journey from Virginia south to Florida traverses the region in which longleaf pine abounds. This is a stately tree, sometimes attaining a height of 120 feet, with a trunk five feet in diameter. Often it forms extensive forests along the coastal plain. The long leaves clustered near the ends of the branches give a strikingly feathery and quite distinctive appearance to the tree. When in bloom, the clustered spikes of flowers are very beautiful. Clouds of pollen are blown from them by the wind. This tree is the principal source of turpentine, pine tar, and rosin. The wood is hard and strong and either light red or orange in color.

Longleaf pine ranges along the coast from Texas to Florida, and northward to Virginia.

The specimen sketched was obtained on Ladys Island, near Beaufort, South Carolina.

PLATE 139",LONGLEAF PINE,Pinus palustris Miller,"Longleaf pine ranges along the coast from Texas to Florida, and northward to Virginia.","The specimen sketched was obtained on Ladys Island, near Beaufort, South Carolina.",139,139,42667732,South Carolina,USA
"FRINGETREE

Chionanthus virginica Linnaeus

When the tender leaves of spring have developed so that the woods are just beginning to appear green, the blossoms of the fringetree present a great mass of feathery white, strikingly contrasting with the neighboring trees. The fringetree is a shrub or small tree belonging to the Olive Family, and a near relative of the ash. In the south, it is commonly termed slawbush in reference to the long slender white corolla lobes. It is found in either swamps or exposed and often rather dry situations, being one of those interesting plants which are relatively indifferent to wetness or dryness so long as the soil possesses a fair degree of acidity. Our native species is often planted for ornament, but unless some care is taken to acidify its soil, the leaves turn yellow by midsummer and fall in early autumn.

The fringetree ranges from Florida to Texas and Missouri, and northward to New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

PLATE 140",FRINGETREE,Chionanthus virginica Linnaeus,"The fringetree ranges from Florida to Texas and Missouri, and northward to New Jersey and Pennsylvania.","The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.",140,140,42667733,District of Columbia,USA
"AMERICAN COLUMBINE

Aquilegia canadensis Linnaeus

Of all the spring wildflowers, none is more lovely than the columbine which we find in rocky woods or on exposed ledges. Its bright green leaves and crimson-and-gold flowers are borne on slender, graceful stems. The bumblebees are attracted to the feast of nectar prepared for them, and the brilliant color attracts also the ruby-throated hummingbird. Taken to England by a relative of John Tradescant, gardener to King Charles the First, the American columbine has yielded steadily to cultivation, but is never so lovely as when growing in its native habitat. Linnaeus gave the genus its name from a fancied resemblance of the spurts of the flower to the talons of an eagle.

American columbine ranges from Georgia to Texas, and northward to Nova Scotia and Northwest Territory. Closely related species grow in Florida.

The specimen sketched was found near Washington, District of Columbia.

PLATE 141",AMERICAN COLUMBINE,Aquilegia canadensis Linnaeus,"American columbine ranges from Georgia to Texas, and northward to Nova Scotia and Northwest Territory.","The specimen sketched was found near Washington, District of Columbia.",141,141,42667734,District of Columbia,USA
"SOUTHERN COAST VIOLET

Viola septemloba Le Conte

This southern plant is one of our most showy violets, with larger blossoms than most of its northern relatives. It grows in light, acid soil, often in nearly pure sand, and is found in pine barrens from Mississippi and Florida northward to southeastern Virginia. The leaves exhibit unusual variation in the number and shape of their lobes, so that judging from leaf shape alone, one would often assume that several species were represented in a single colony of the plants, were it not for the fact that the form of flowers and seed pods is so uniform.

The sketch was made from a specimen collected in North Carolina, and brought into flower in the greenhouses of the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, District of Columbia.

"MAYAPPLE

Podophyllum peltatum Linnaeus

The mayapple is one of our familiar plants of spring, with its umbrella-shaped leaves and its cream-colored flowers hanging shyly below the forked leaf stalk. The flower is soon followed by an egg-shaped fruit which may be eaten when ripe, though the flavor is not especially good. Mayapples prefer a rich soil in partially shaded situations. The genus contains five species, all except this one being natives of Asia. They are members of the Barberry Family. The name mandrake, which belongs to an old-world plant of another family, is often misapplied in America to the mayapple.

The mayapple ranges from Florida to Texas, and northward to Quebec, Ontario, and Minnesota.

The specimen sketched was found at Washington, District of Columbia.

"WOOD MERRYBELLS

Uvularia perfoliata Linnaeus

Wood merrybells, a graceful and attractive plant belonging to the Lily-of-the-valley Family, is common in rich, moist woods in May or June. The flowers hang singly on a slender stem. So many more striking flowers are in bloom at the same season that the species of merrybells are easily overlooked.

The specimen sketched was found near Rock Creek Park, Washington, District of Columbia, but the plant ranges from Georgia, Tennessee, and Kansas northward to Quebec, Ontario, and Minnesota.

"GOLDENSTAR

Chrysogonum virginianum Linnaeus

Goldenstar is a showy and handsome plant of moist or dry woodlands. What appear to be its flowers are heads made up of numerous tiny tubular flowers, each of the five outer ones having its corolla transformed into a golden ray. The first flower heads bloom in spring, but the plant often continues to produce new blossoms from its lengthening stems until midsummer. The early-flowering plants, with their compact tufts of hairy leaves, are much more beautiful than the sprawling and weather-beaten plants of summer. Goldenstar is the only representative of its genus. It is seldom a common plant, but it is particularly abundant in the neighborhood of Washington, District of Columbia, where the specimen sketched was collected.

Goldenstar ranges from Florida and Alabama northward to southern Pennsylvania.

"HIGHBUSH BLACKBERRY

Rubus avrgutus Link

Highbush blackberry, when in bloom, is one of our most showy bushes. It is then a mass of tender white flowers with a background of dark green leaves. It adorns roadsides, fence corners, and waste places, wherever it can find an undisturbed space. A little later it is loaded with fine clusters of red and green fruit, black and luscious when ripe. The blackberries cultivated in America are improved forms of the wild species. They belong to the Rose Family.

This particular species of blackberry prefers a dry soil, and ranges, mostly at low altitudes, from Virginia northward to Massachusetts. Closely related species covet a much wider territory.

The specimen sketched grew at Washington, District of Columbia.

"CROW POISON

Chrospermum muscactoxicum (Walter) Kuntze

Crow poison is found in sandy woods. It has a graceful and attractive spike of creamy white flowers and buds, the lower ones expanding first. It grows from a bulb nearly an inch in diameter and blooms from May to July. The seeds are reddish brown, and this fact gives the motive for the generic name, derived from the Greek and referring to the colored seeds. The genus consists of a single species. This plant is remarkable in that it contains one of the most toxic alkaloids known to science. In the Southern Appalachians, it often poisons cattle, which mistake its leaves for grass in the spring. In this respect, it recalls its relationship to the western deathcamas, another member of the Bunchflower Family.

Crow poison ranges from Florida to Tennessee and Arkansas and northward to Virginia and Long Island.

The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"CANADA LILY

Lilium canadense Linnaeus

The habit of the Canada lily is striking, for it rises above its surrounding meadow companions, its tall, stout stem decorated with regular whorls of bright green leaves, from the uppermost of which the flower stalks spring, the flowers drooping in a circle around them. The pendent position of the flowers shelters the pollen-laden anthers from the summer showers, and sometimes the bees take refuge from the rain under their golden caps. This species grows in richer woods than its relative, the American turkscap lily, and varies in color from the yellow here shown to a rather bright red.

Canada lilies are found from Georgia and Alabama to Missouri, and northward to Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Nebraska.

The specimen sketched was found near Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.

"AMERICAN WISTERIA

Kraunhea frutescens (Linnaeus) Greene

American wisteria is a woody vine, climbing over trees and bushes. Its stem reaches several inches in diameter and as much as forty feet in length. The showy blue or lilac flowers are borne in abundance, though the racemes are shorter than those of the Chinese wisteria so frequently seen in our gardens. Wisteria was named in memory of Dr. Caspar Wistar of Philadelphia.

American wisteria is found in low grounds from Texas to Arkansas and Florida and northward to Virginia.

The specimen sketched grew near Savannah, Georgia.

"CURLY CLEMATIS

Clematis crispa Linnaeus

The graceful flowers of curly clematis are almost of the texture of crêpe, and the leaves add to the dainty beauty of the vine. This clematis is a close relative of the leatherflower, and like that is sometimes referred to a separate genus, Viorna. Its fruit is a mass of hard seed-like achenes, each tipped with a long feathery tail. It is a member of the Buttercup Family.

Curly clematis is distributed from Florida to Texas, and northward to Virginia and Missouri.

The specimen sketched grew near Yemassee, South Carolina.

"WESTERN YARROW

Achillea lanulosa Nuttall

Western yarrow is such a common plant that we usually pass it by without appreciation of its beauty. Growing everywhere, and especially in neglected places, its white heads and feathery foliage are known to everyone. The crushed leaves and flowers have a pungent and somewhat irritant odor, which sometimes causes sneezing. Forms in which the heads have pink instead of white rays are not uncommon in the Rocky Mountains. A closely related species of very similar appearance is a weed in fields and waste places in the eastern United States. The genus name of these plants was given in commemoration of Achilles.

Western yarrow ranges from Oklahoma to Mexico and California, and northward to Quebec, Ontario, Michigan, and Yukon.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the valley of the Red Deer River, twenty miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,700 feet.

"TAMPA EPIDENDRUM

Epidendrum tampense Lindley

It is only in Florida and westward along the Gulf Coast in the United States that we find the mild and moist climate suitable for the growth of epiphytic orchids, a group characteristic of tropical forests. In the dense cypress swamps of southern Florida, this Epidendrum grows commonly, the slender plants forming masses of hard bulbs and stiff fleshy leaves on the upper portions of the trunks and branches of various trees. The trees in the Florida keys and the southern parts of the mainland are often loaded with a dense growth of epiphytes, chiefly bromeliads, orchids, ferns, and mosses. In spring, Tampa epidendrum sends forth its graceful panicles of flowers, which are handsome, although inferior to some of the very numerous tropical species of the genus.

The Tampa epidendrum grows in southern Florida where the specimen sketched was collected, and also in the Bahamas and Cuba.

"TILLANDSIA

Tillandsia fasciculata Swartz

The tillandsias, of the Pineapple Family, are represented in the United States by about fifteen species, most of which are confined to Florida. All the members of the family are American, and in the tropics they are very numerous. The species here illustrated, like most members of the family, is an epiphyte, or air-plant, growing upon the trunks or branches of trees, usually in swamps, and deriving its food from water and decayed vegetable matter that lodges about its roots. The tillandsias often grow with orchids, and frequently have quite as showy blossoms. Their flowers, however, are extremely delicate and wither quickly. The leaves usually are covered densely with minute scales, which give a gray aspect to the plant, and have been supposed to prevent evaporation from the leaves, but more probably serve to hold rainwater while the plant is extracting nutrient substances from it. The numerous seeds are furnished with tufts of hairs, and thus are distributed widely by the wind.

This tillandsia came from Florida, but the species is widely dispersed in the West Indies, Mexico, and Central and South America.

"SPIDERLILY

Hymenocallis rotata (Ker) Herbert

This species of spiderlily is an inhabitant of sandy beaches, growing just beyond the reach of the surf. In such locations, it usually forms dense clumps of fifty or more bulbs. The broad, green sword-like leaves of this and related species form a conspicuous element of some Florida and West Indian beaches. The spiderlily, a member of the Amaryllis Family, grows from a large bulb.

This species ranges from Florida to the coastal plain of North Carolina.

The specimen here drawn came from Loggerhead Key, Dry Tortugas, Florida.

"LLOYDS STRAWBERRY-CACTUS

Echinocereus lloydii Britton and Rose

The brilliant cactus flowers of the southwestern United States are noticed by everyone traveling to California by train in the spring. At this season the apparently dead plants, often growing in grotesque shapes, are awakened by the first showers of the rainy season. Then the deserts are gorgeous with bloom, and colors in the artist’s box are inadequate to depict the various hues and shades of color in the myriads of flowers. The Cactus Family, embracing more than 1,200 species, is strictly American, although since the time of Columbus many of its members have been introduced into the Old World, where some of them have become serious pests.

This cactus is of limited range. It is found only in western Texas, where this specimen was collected.

"GHOSTPIPE

Thalesia uniflora (Linnaeus) Britton

Ghostpipe is one of the strange plants parasitic on the roots of various herbs. It frequents dry or moist woodlands, and is one of our spring flowers. Like other similar parasitic plants, it lacks chlorophyll, and hence all green coloration. The foliage, too, is greatly reduced, the leaves being represented by a few inconspicuous scales. The plant belongs to the Broomrape Family. Some botanists use the name Aphylon instead of Thalesia.

Ghostpipe occurs from South Carolina and Texas northward to Newfoundland and Ontario.

The specimen sketched grew on Plummers Island, near Washington, District of Columbia.

"PALE PINESAP

Hypopitys americana (De Candolle) Small

Pale pinesap is a woodland plant, preferring moist situations. It blooms in late summer. The succulent stems are provided with scales in place of leaves, and the whole plant is devoid of green coloration. It is not a parasite like ghostpipe, but is saprophytic, that is, it obtains its nourishment from decomposing vegetable matter, after the fashion of the mushrooms. In aspect, it is similar to its close relative, the red pinesap, but lacks the bright coloring of that species. It belongs to the Indian Pipe Family, degenerate relatives of the heaths.

One of more species of pinesap occur in woods from Florida to Newfoundland and Ontario. A very similar plant is found in Europe, but the relationships of the several species have not been finally determined.

The specimen sketched was found near Washington, District of Columbia.

"ARUM ARROWHEAD

Sagittaria cuneata Sheldon

This arrowhead, like its relatives, loves mud and water, sending up its graceful leaves and flower stalks, with delicate flowers, out of the muck. The name Sagittaria, derived from the Latin, refers to the arrow-shaped leaves. The plant belongs to the Waterplantain Family.

Arrowhead ranges from Connecticut to Maine and Nova Scotia, and westward to Kansas, New Mexico, California, and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was found near Edgewater, British Columbia, in the valley of the Columbia River, at an elevation of 2,700 feet.

"SPATTERDOCK

Nymphaea advena Solander

Spatterdocks, sometimes called yellow pondlilies, abound along the banks of sluggish streams and ponds. We usually think of them as coarse plants, though Longfellow, having in mind the northern spatterdock with its floating leaves, tells us that Hiawatha’s canoe

. . . floated on the river
Like a yellow leaf in autumn,
Like a yellow water-lily.

Indeed, with other plants that like to have their roots in the mud, they hide much that is unlovely on the borders of streams. The seeds of a closely related species of the Pacific Coast furnished an important food for the Indians.

This species of spatterdock has a wide range, extending from Florida to Texas and northward to southern New York and Wisconsin. Closely related species occur almost throughout the United States, and in Canada, Alaska, and Europe.

The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"PINELAND ASTER

Aster squarrosus Walter

Some of the southern asters are very different in appearance from the common forms of the North, and one of the most curious is the pineland aster. It is common in many parts of Florida, growing in the sandy pine lands, which seem dry in winter, but are very wet in the rainy summer. The slender plants are one to two feet high, with stiff, brittle stems, which are usually much branched, and often form dense tangled masses. The most striking characteristic of this species is its minute leaves, which are extremely numerous, and spreading, or often reflexed. It flowers in autumn, like most asters, but continues in bloom throughout the winter.

The pineland aster ranges through most of Florida and northward to the coast of North Carolina.

"BOTTLE GENTIAN

Gentiana saponaria Linnaeus

In autumn, long after most of our flowers except goldenrods and asters have faded, the bottle gentian is found in blossom in the thickets bordering woodlands. Unlike its better-known relative, the fringed gentian, it is a perennial, and may be sought with some confidence year after year in the same locality. Its richly colored flowers, of a hue rare at any season, are a delight to the eye when other flowers are so scarce. Blue and purple flowers often have albino forms, and the bottle gentian is no exception, as plants with pure white corollas are not unusual.

Bottle gentian ranges from Florida and Louisiana northward to Connecticut and Ontario, and closely related species are even more widely distributed.

The specimen sketched came from the vicinity of Washington, District of Columbia.

"WESTERN MOUNTAIN-ASH

Sorbus sambucifolia (Chamisso and Schlechtendal) Roemer

Western mountain-ash usually grows in stony places, beneath large trees or in openings in the forest. In especially favorable situations, it sometimes develops into a tree 20 feet high. It is not a relative of the ashes, as its name would imply, but belongs to the Apple Family. The brilliant scarlet fruits, resembling miniature apples, are a favorite food of birds, especially in winter. The flavor of these fruits is not agreeable to the human palate, although when crushed in water they yield a subacid beverage that is not unpleasant. The small white flowers, which unfold in spring, are arranged in broad, flat-topped clusters. The buds, before expansion, are cream-colored. The open flowers are very sweet-scented.

A related European species is called rowan-tree or rowan.

This species of mountain-ash ranges from the southern Rockies of Arizona and New Mexico, northward to Alberta and Alaska. It is known also from Siberia.

The specimen from which the painting was made grew on the motor road near Vermilion Summit, about twelve miles from Castle Station, Alberta, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"PLUME ANEMONE

Pulsatilla occidentalis (Watson) Freyn

Those whose fancy has led them in spring or summer to the higher parts of the Canadian Rocky Mountains have been thrilled with the loveliness of this beautiful anemone as it springs up at the edges of retreating snow banks on the alpine slopes and valleys. The flowers begin to open when the stems are only an inch high and still nestle in a mass of grayish-green furry buds and half unfolded leaves. Within a few days the stems lengthen, and each bears a large, creamy flower with golden and green center, the blossoms contrasting with the background of pale green foliage. As they fade the flowers are sometimes tinged with blue.

The plume anemone belongs to the Crowfoot Family. It ranges from California and Montana northward to Alberta and Alaska.

The specimen sketched grew near Lake O'Hara, fifteen miles by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"PLUME ANEMONE

Pulsatilla occidentalis (Watson) Freyn

In the long days of June and July the seeds of alpine plants ripen rapidly, and the flowers of the plume anemone soon are replaced by silvery gray-green seed heads. These are almost as beautiful as the flowers, and the head of silky seed tails, all smoothed sleekly from the center of the cluster, reminds one of nothing so much as the crown of a child’s curly head. When ripe the ""seeds"" are easily detached from the stem, the long feathery tail supporting them on their wind-blown journey in search of a favorable situation for germination. These seed heads are relished by the marmots, which eat them upon the spot, or carry them to their winter caches. The marmots also pile them into soft beds in their burrows.

This member of the Crowfoot Family ranges from Montana to California and northward to Alberta and Alaska.

The specimen sketched was collected near the summit of the pass at the head of Johnson Creek, Alberta, Canada, at an elevation of 8,500 feet.

"MEADOW FLEABANE

Erigeron speciosus De Candolle

Meadow fleabane is a brilliant member of the Aster Family, and is one of a large group of closely related plants which attain their fullest development in the western United States. It grows in meadows and in moist, open woodlands. The flower head at the top of the stem is larger than the heads which expand later, and when the plant is at its best it presents a perfect bloom surrounded by several half-open buds. As the species is plentiful in favorable situations, it gives a gay aspect to the slopes in the lower altitudes of the Rocky Mountains in June and July.

Meadow fleabane ranges from Utah and Colorado to Oregon and Alberta.

The sketch was made from a specimen gathered at Ghost River, twenty-five miles from Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"STAR SOLOMONPLUME

Vagnera stellata (Linnaeus) Morong

Star solomonplume loves moist rich woods. In its habit of growth and in the appearance of the flowers, it recalls vaguely the lily-of-the-valley. By their rootstocks, the plants spread widely, forming extensive patches in the woodlands. The rootstocks show no trace of the seal-like scars so characteristic of the solomonseals. The plant is graceful in form and beautiful when in either flower or fruit. It belongs to the Lily-of-the-valley Family, which includes asparagus, lily-of-the-valley, and mertensia bells. The fruit is a small globular berry, at first green, with three dark vertical stripes, but turning black when quite ripe. Some botanists use the name Smilacina stellata for this plant.

Star solomonplume ranges from Virginia to New Mexico and California, and northward to Newfoundland and Alaska. It grows also in northern Europe.

The specimen sketched was obtained at Lake Minnewonka, near Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.

"DOUBLE BLADDERPOD

Physaria didymocarpa (Hooker) Gray

The double bladderpod is a curious plant of unusual appearance. It thrives best in dry limestone soils on steep mountain sides, or in the deposits of glacial streams. The many pale blue-green leaves form a rosette upon the surface of the soil, from which spring the delicate gray stems bearing four-petaled yellow flowers. The root is long, thick, woody, and tough. In its aspect, the plant suggests an alpine species. It belongs to the Mustard Family.

Double bladderpod ranges from Colorado to Utah and northward to Saskatchewan and Alberta.

The specimen sketched grew near Lake Louise seven miles from Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.

"DOUBLE BLADDERPOD

Physaria didymocarpa (Hooker) Gray

The hot sun of the long June days of northern latitudes soon develops the seed vessels of the double bladderpod, and the reason for the common name is then disclosed. When decorated with the many inflated seed pods, the plant is unique in appearance and more conspicuous than when in bloom. The generic name Physaria is derived from a Greek word signifying bellows, in allusion to the form of the fruits. About six species of Physaria are known, all of them natives of western North America.

Double bladderpod ranges from Colorado to Utah and northward to Saskatchewan and Alberta.

The specimen sketched grew near Ptarmigan Pass, ten miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

"GROUSE WHORTLEBERRY

Vaccinium scoparium Leiberg

The higher slopes of the western mountains, just below tree line, are often covered with widespread patches of grouse whortleberry. The dwarf bushes are only six to twelve inches in height, with shortly angled, slender green branches. The small, thin, finely toothed leaves are bright green. Underneath the foliage, and half hidden by it, hang the dainty little pink flower bells. The plants prefer well-drained, forested slopes, which are not too densely shaded, but they often grow profusely in even the denser forest. Like other whortleberries, and its close relatives, the blueberries, it is restricted to acid soils.

Grouse whortleberry ranges in the higher mountains from New Mexico to California, and northward to Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Hector, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"GROUSE WHORTLEBERRY

Vaccinium scoparium Leiberg

Grouse whortleberries mature rapidly, and by the middle of August the plants are well fruited with pleasantly flavored bright red berries. These are much enjoyed by grouse, which are usually found where the berries are plentiful.

Grouse whortleberry occurs in the higher mountains from New Mexico to California, and northward to Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was collected in the valley of the Red Deer River twenty miles by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"BUFF PUSSY TOES

Antennaria luzuloides Torrey and Gray

In the Rocky Mountain region over forty species of Antennaria, or pussytoes, are known, and many others grow in the Eastern States and along the Pacific Coast. They are members of the great Aster Family. In most of the species, the plants have long, slender, leafy runners or sterile shoots, spreading over the ground in every direction to form dense mats, but such runners are absent in the species here illustrated. This is a slender erect plant, usually four to fifteen inches high. It grows on open, rocky or grassy slopes at middle altitudes in the mountains, or even above timber line. In many parts of the United States, the species of Antennaria are known as Indian tobacco, and the leaves are chewed by children.

Buff pussytoes ranges from Wyoming and Montana westward to Oregon and British Columbia.

The specimen figured was obtained in the valley of the Siffleur River forty-five miles from Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.

"SMALL PYROLA

Pyrola minor Linnaeus

The small pyrola delights in wet places. We find it flourishing in bogs or on oozing stream banks, usually in densely shaded situations. Flowering in midsummer, its rosy pink saucers lend a touch of color to its otherwise dull surroundings. The flowers vary greatly in depth of color, and occasionally they are white. They are smaller and fewer than those of the bog pyrola, which is a species more generally distributed and locally more abundant.

The small pyrola has a wide range in the colder parts of North America, extending from Massachusetts to Colorado and California, and northward to the Arctic regions. It grows also in Europe and Asia.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the valley of the Pipestone River, about ten miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.

"WESTERN BLUEBELLS

Mertensia paniculata (Aiton) Don

We have seen bluebells but rarely in our Western travels. Unlike its cousin, the Virginia bluebells, this plant is hairy, and the smaller, less numerous flowers are much deeper in color. The plant inhabits moist woodlands, where it often forms large clumps. Western bluebells belongs to the Borage Family, and is a relative of forget-me-not and heliotrope.

This species of bluebells ranges from Iowa to Washington and Alaska, and extends eastward to Lake Superior and Hudson Bay.

The specimen sketched was collected near Lake Minnewonka, eleven miles from Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"GREEN BEARCABBAGE

Veratrum viride Aiton

Wherever green bearcabbage grows, it is always a conspicuous plant, in spite of the fact that its flowers are scarcely different in color from the foliage. In the West, it loves the moist, rich soil of mountain meadows and valleys. The leaves are strongly veined and have a plaited appearance. The plant is coarse and tall, the flower panicles often rising five feet above the ground. The sturdy shoots of this plant push through the soil when the earliest spring flowers unfold, as soon as the snow has melted, and at that time its fresh green color is most attractive. It belongs to the Bunchflower Family and, like some of its neat relatives, is poisonous. The poison is chiefly in the root, however, and when there is a shortage of other forage, animals often graze on bearcabbage without ill effect.

Green bearcabbage is found over much of the cooler parts of North America from Virginia to Tennessee and Oregon, and northward.

The sketch was made from a specimen obtained in the Bow Valley, thirty miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

"SAGEBRUSH MARIPOSA

Calochortus macrocarpus Douglas

The genus Calochortus, comprising the mariposas, which are often called mariposa lilies or butterfly tulips, the globe-tulips, and several kinds of pussy-ears, contains about fifty species. Nearly all of them are so beautiful that they command the admiration of all who see them. Our experience with the sagebrush mariposa was a revelation of nature’s methods. Our camp had been pitched on a dry bench fifty feet above the Kootenay River near Canal Flats, British Columbia, where the sparse vegetation indicated a lack of moisture. One night a heavy storm of wind and rain came up. A few days later the miracle was manifest, for all around the tent the buds of the sagebrush mariposa were almost ready to unfold, and soon the plants were in perfect bloom. There are myriads of them in some parts of the Columbia River Valley, where the little prairies are colored purple with their flowers.

This mariposa is found in sagebrush plains from Montana to Oregon and northward to British Columbia.

The specimen figured was sketched at the camp mentioned above, near Canal Flats, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"WHITE DRYAD

Dryas octopetala Linnaeus

White dryad is a very decorative plant in its chosen habitat. It flourishes best in a soil of disintegrated limestone, and it is also found clinging to rough limestone rocks, where it forms close mats, its green foliage hiding the interlaced masses of woody stems and dead leaves beneath. Above these mats, the beautiful cup-shaped flowers with their golden centers are borne on dainty stems from one to four inches tall. The flowers attract many bees and small flies. The stems and leaves are sticky and have a resinous odor.

White dryad belongs to the Rose Family, and is found from Labrador and Greenland throughout Arctic America, and in the Rocky Mountains from Utah and Colorado to British Columbia. It occurs also in northern Europe and Asia.

The sketch was made from plants that grew in Skoki Valley, fifteen miles by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.

"WHITE DRYAD

Dryas octopetala Linnaeus

The flowers of white dryad are quickly withered by the hot sun of midsummer, their stems lengthen, and the twisted fruit head appears, later spreading into a ball of 'seeds'. These are each provided with a silky tail, which enables the wind to carry the seeds to distant places. At a certain stage, before the heads are fully ripe, the ponies are fond of them. At this time the plants often give a misty pink color to the areas they occupy.

White dryad occurs on limestone soils from Labrador and Greenland throughout Arctic America, in the Rocky Mountains from Utah and Colorado to British Columbia, and in Europe and Asia.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the valley of the Siffleur River, fifty miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

"MOSS GENTIAN

Gentiana prostrata Haenke

This tiny gentian will escape all but the keenest eyes. The flowers open only in bright sunshine, and the stems creep through the grass, as though to elude detection. The corollas are usually of the brightest blue, but sometimes they are white. The minute green leaves have a narrow white cartilaginous border which is not found in other gentians. This is a truly alpine plant. It is the smallest of the North American gentians.

The moss gentian ranges from the Colorado Rockies to Alberta and Alaska and the Arctic regions of the Old World. The American plant differs slightly from the typical Eurasian form and is sometimes recognized as variety americana.

This specimen was found near the shore of Lake Magog at the base of Mount Assiniboine, Alberta, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.

"LOW WHORTLEBERRY

Vaccinium caespitosum Michaux

The low whortleberry, hidden among the grass, on gentle slopes of alpine meadows, is unlike most other members of its group, for it grows only from three to seven inches tall. It has woody stems, much branched, and in spring bears a heavy load of lovely white or pink bells. These later develop into blue berries which are covered with an attractive bloom. The leaves turn a deep red color in autumn.

The low whortleberry may be found from New Hampshire to Labrador, and in the Rocky Mountains from Colorado to British Columbia and Alaska and westward to California.

We found the specimen sketched at Bow Lake, twenty-five miles north of Lake Louise Station, British Columbia, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"SMALL CRANBERRY

Oxycoccus palustris Persoon

The small cranberry is a typical boreal plant, and no doubt survived the glacial period close to the margin of the ice sheet, or on mountain summits which projected above the ice. Upon the retreat of the glaciers the plant migrated from its places of refuge into the many bogs formed by the damming of rivulets. It now ranges throughout the glaciated territory of the Northern Hemisphere, extending well into the Arctic region. In North America, it is found as far south as New Jersey, Michigan, and the State of Washington. The cranberries belong to the Blueberry Family. By many botanists, they are referred to the genus Vaccinium, which contains the blueberries and whortleberries.

The specimen sketched grew at Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, near the point where Lake Louise Creek flows out of the lake, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"PURPLE MOUNTAIN VIOLET

Viola adunca J. E. Smith

The purple mountain violet is a small plant of the higher altitudes, whose flowers are large in proportion to the size of the leaves. It nestles in the grass and other herbage as though to hide its lovely blossoms, and soon fades in the hot sunshine of early summer. The painting represents an unusual dwarfish form of this species, which at lower altitudes is a taller, longer-stemmed plant, especially when it grows in wet, shaded spots.

Viola adunca has a wide range, being found from New Hampshire and New Brunswick to the mountains of New Mexico and California, and north to Alaska.

The specimen sketched grew near the shores of Bow Lake, thirty miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"ROSETTE CINQUEFOIL

Potentilla uniflora Ledebour

Rosette cinquefoil is a plant seldom seen by the traveler, for it loves rocky places at high altitudes, to which it is hard to climb. It grows in tufts or bunches from a mass of stout, woody, interlaced underground stems. Its rich yellow flowers, so large in proportion to the size of the plant, remind one of a small yellow rose. The leaves of this species have three leaflets instead of the five or more possessed by most Potentillas. It belongs to the Rose Family.

Rosette cinquefoil ranges from Colorado northward through the Rockies to the Arctic regions and westward to Oregon. It grows also in Greenland and Asia.

The specimen sketched was obtained on the rocky slopes above the source of Ranger Brook in the Sawback Range, fifteen miles west of Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.

"SIDESADDLE GOLDENROD

Solidago ciliosa Greene

Although sidesaddle goldenrod is a dwarf plant, it is a showy member of its group, for it has much larger flowers than most of the goldenrods found in the western mountains. It enjoys steep mountain slopes, where it is conspicuous among the many flowers that grow beside the trails. The flower heads are equally large when the plants grow at high altitudes, even though the stems may be only an inch long.

Sidesaddle goldenrod is found from Arizona and Colorado northward to Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was obtained on the trail leading to Burgess Pass about seven miles from Field, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

Saxifraga caespitosa Linnaeus

Tufted saxifrage grows among disintegrating rocks, usually where moisture is seeping through from the slopes above. One of its peculiarities is the tuft of green leaves at the base of each of the dainty flower stems, which are usually arranged in a graceful way. This species is very variable in size, and the most reduced alpine form is shown in the illustration.

Tufted saxifrage ranges through Canada to Greenland and westward to Alaska. It is found also in northern Asia and Europe.

"PYGMY ANDROSACE

Androsace subumbellata (A. Nelson) Small

Pygmy androsace is a tiny member of the Primrose Family, which, because of its small size and inconspicuous coloring, easily escapes notice. It grows in meadows or on stony alpine slopes. The delicate slender stems and white flowers give it a graceful and dainty appearance quite in contrast to that of the sweet androsace, previously pictured.

"WESTERN GREEN ALDER

Alnus sinuata (Regel) Rydberg

Thickets of green alder are the bane of the mountaineer, for their hard, gnarled stems interlace to form an impenetrable tangle. On mountain sides, where, in early spring, snow slides have plunged down the steep slopes, weighing the alders to the ground, it is almost impossible to climb up against them. The rich green of their foliage combines well with their surroundings. The plant is especially interesting towards autumn, when a single branch may carry the remains of last year’s fruits as well as this year’s, and in addition the catkins ready for next year’s early display of flowers.

Western green alder belongs to the Birch Family, which contains some of the hardiest shrubs and trees. This species is found from Wyoming to California and northward to Alaska, and is especially abundant in the Selkirk Mountains.

The specimen sketched was gathered at Glacier, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"GIANT ARBORVITAE

Thuja plicata Don

Giant arborvitae flourishes in rich, moist soil, and, as the name implies, the trees grow to great size. They frequently rise far above the surrounding forest, and their smooth columnar trunks, with pale, reddish gray bark, are very striking. The branches become pendent, from the weight of the fruit, and the little cones stand erect on the hanging twigs, presenting a very unusual effect. Both foliage and immature fruit are rich green in color.

Giant arborvitae is found from Montana to California, extending northward to Alaska.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the Columbia River Valley, thirty miles south of Golden, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.

"LIMBER PINE

Pinus flexilis James

Limber pine appears to enjoy growing in difficult positions and is often seen springing from clefts in the rocks on the mountain sides, where it would seem impossible for a tree to obtain a foothold. The branches are exceedingly flexible, bending readily under the heavy weight of the developing cones, and seeming scarcely able to withstand the strain.

Limber pine is found in the Rocky Mountain region from northern Mexico to Alberta, and in some of the higher desert ranges westward to southern California.

The specimen sketched was obtained from Devils Gap, east of Lake Minnewonka, twenty-five miles from Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"NORTHERN BUTTERBUR

Petasites hyperboreus Rydberg

Northern butterbur is rarely seen in bloom by visitors to the Canadian Rockies because it flowers very early in the season. The silky seed heads topping its stout woolly stems are not likely to attract attention. If, in summer, one is fortunate enough to find a sheltered spot where the ice and snow have recently melted, the northern butterbur is sometimes found in flower, grouped with spring beauties and buttercups, in swampy soil or near snow water rivulets. The flowers are sweet-scented and brightly colored. The ponies dearly love to eat the plant to vary still further their diet of “all sorts of feed.”

This species of butterbur ranges from the mountains of Washington and Alberta northward to the Arctic Coast, from Hudson Bay to Alaska.

The specimen sketched was found at Vermilion Pass, thirty-five miles south of Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

"AMERICAN VETCH

Vicia americana Muhlenberg

American vetch is one of the most graceful and beautiful members of its group. It loves moist ground, and may be found in open meadows, in brushy thickets, or even in the forest. It is a weak vine, clinging for support to its neighbors by the forked tendrils which tip the leaves in a hold almost impossible to disentangle. The fruit is a small flat pod.

American vetch ranges widely, being found from Virginia west to Arizona and north to New Brunswick and Alaska.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"SAUSSUREA

Saussurea densa (Hooker) Rydberg

Saussurea is one of the rarer members of the Aster Family. It is nearly related to the thistles, but in habit of growth and in the size of its flower heads it is very different. It prefers stony limestone slopes of moraines, and is confined to the higher altitudes. The flowers, growing in dense heads, are attractive to bees. After the flowers have faded the downy “seeds” form an equally showy flat head.

In the Canadian Rockies, saussurea is a conspicuous plant because it is so different from any other flower. Its range is limited to that region.

The specimen sketched was obtained near the base of Tilted Mountain, fifteen miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

PLATE 191",SAUSSUREA,Saussurea densa (Hooker) Rydberg,Its range is limited to that region.,"The specimen sketched was obtained near the base of Tilted Mountain, fifteen miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.",191,191,42669653,Alberta,Canada
"BROOK LOBELIA

Lobelia kalmii Linnaeus

Brook lobelia is abundant locally in the Canadian Rockies. The sturdiest specimens seen were growing beside a brook that found its way through a bed of disintegrated calcareous tufa. It is a dainty and pretty plant, though not to be compared in showiness with its relatives, the cardinal flower and the large blue lobelia.

The range of brook lobelia is wide—in moist calcareous soils from New Jersey northward to Newfoundland and westward to Iowa and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Canal Flats, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.

PLATE 192",BROOK LOBELIA,Lobelia kalmii Linnaeus,The range of brook lobelia is wide—in moist calcareous soils from New Jersey northward to Newfoundland and westward to Iowa and British Columbia.,"The specimen sketched was obtained near Canal Flats, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.",192,192,42669654,British Columbia,Canada
"MOUNTAIN CRANBERRY

Vaccinium vitis-idaea minus Loddiges

There is a striking contrast between the deep green of mountain cranberry leaves and the dainty bunches of white bells at the tips of the woody stems. The sweet-scented flowers are frequently tinged with pink. The plant, like other members of the Blueberry Family, delights in acid soil.

Mountain cranberry grows neatly throughout the colder parts of North America, occurring rarely in New England and southern Canada, but becoming a common plant in high mountain and Arctic lowland regions. It presumably survived the glacial period on some of the non-glaciated islands, and when the ice retreated it rapidly occupied the devastated territory, its seeds being widely dispersed by birds. The typical form of the species is similarly distributed in Europe and Asia.

The specimen sketched was obtained on the shores of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,500 feet.

PLATE 193",MOUNTAIN CRANBERRY,Vaccinium vitis-idaea minus Loddiges,"Mountain cranberry grows neatly throughout the colder parts of North America, occurring rarely in New England and southern Canada, but becoming a common plant in high mountain and Arctic lowland regions.","The specimen sketched was obtained on the shores of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,500 feet.",193,193,42669655,Alberta,Canada
"MOUNTAIN CRANBERRY

Vaccinium vitisidaea minus Loddiges

The fruit of the mountain cranberry is sour, but it is relished by birds, and its beautiful red color always attracts the eye. Where conditions of moisture and soil acidity are favorable, the stems cover the ground in dense mats, and the berries attain twice the size of those on plants found in dry, sterile situations.

The mountain cranberry grows throughout the colder parts of North America, its southernmost known station being in northeastern Massachusetts.

The specimen sketched was procured in the valley of the Siffleur River, fifty miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"WOOLLY AGOSERIS

Agoseris villosa Rydberg

When we were climbing the slopes of Survey Peak, which rises from the right bank of Glacier Lake, this showy plant was very prominent at an altitude of 7,500 feet. Our camp was pitched in the timber a quarter of a mile from the outlet of the lake, and there was some distance to be covered over a rough trail, among the willows, alders, and other thick, bushy vegetation, before the grassy slopes and bare rocks were reached. Here the sturdy stems of woolly agoseris stood from the rosettes of pale leaves, and the golden flowers showed to perfection against the soft gray background of the mountainside. The woody underground stems bore witness to many years of retarded growth resulting from short growing seasons, and from alpine environment. The plant is a member of the Chicory Family, and is related to the dandelion, which it somewhat resembles in general appearance.

Glacier Lake is reached by trail, and is about forty-eight miles northeast of Lake Louise Station, Alberta, Canada.

Woolly agoseris ranges from Utah to Alberta and British Columbia.

PLATE 195",WOOLLY AGOSERIS,Agoseris villosa Rydberg,Woolly agoseris ranges from Utah to Alberta and British Columbia.,"When we were climbing the slopes of Survey Peak, which rises from the right bank of Glacier Lake, this showy plant was very prominent at an altitude of 7,500 feet.",195,195,42669657,British Columbia,Canada
"AMERICAN TWINFLOWER

Linnaea borealis americana (Forbes) Rehder

This dainty plant, named for Linnaeus, the father of modern botany, in accordance with his own choice, by his friend Gronovius, is unsurpassed in modest beauty. It is a trailing evergreen vine, from whose slender branches rise threadlike stems, each bearing two nodding flowers. These are so sweet-scented that the odor sometimes penetrates even into a railroad train passing along a mountainside when the plant is in bloom. It loves the deep recesses of the forest, where it thrives with moss and other plants that demand acid soils. Perhaps this tiny blossom was the inspiration of Linnaeus when he said of the unfolding flowers, “I saw God in his glory passing near me, and bowed my head in worship.”

The twinflower belongs to the Honeysuckle Family. It has a wide range, the American form, which is only slightly different from that of the Old World, being distributed from New Jersey to New Mexico and northward to Greenland and Alaska. The typical form grows in Europe and Asia.

The sketch was made from a specimen obtained at Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5250 feet.

"SAND PHACELIA

Phacelia linearis (Pursh) Holzinger

We found the sand phacelia growing plentifully on a mound of disintegrated limestone in the Columbia River valley. The plant has dainty flowers, which are larger than those of many other Rocky Mountain phacelias. It flourishes in dry soils, blooming freely with a minimum of moisture. The phacelias are exclusively American plants, belonging to the Waterleaf Family. They are most abundant in the Western States, but several members of the group occur along the Atlantic coast, and others extend southward to the mountains of Guatemala.

Sand phacelia has a wide range, from Utah to California, and north to British Columbia and Alberta.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the Columbia River valley, five miles from Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia, at an altitude of 2,500 feet.

PLATE 197",SAND PHACELIA,Phacelia linearis (Pursh) Holzinger,"Sand phacelia has a wide range, from Utah to California, and north to British Columbia and Alberta.","The specimen sketched was obtained in the Columbia River valley, five miles from Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia, at an altitude of 2,500 feet.",197,197,42669659,British Columbia,Canada
"NORTHERN BUTTERWORT

Pinguicula vulgaris Linnaeus

The bright purple flowers of the northern butterwort suggest violets to the casual observer, but on closer examination the plant proves to be very different in its structural details. Its flowers are borne well above the yellow-green waxy leaves, which are greasy to the touch, and form a rosette at the base of the slender flower stems. Like rennet, the leaves of northern butterwort will cause milk to coagulate. The plant always grows in a wet situation, usually in alkaline soil, in swampy places, on wet, gravelly flats, or by the edges of streams. Butterwort belongs to a small group of insectivorous plants, related to the figworts, and with the bladderworts constitutes a special family.

Northern butterwort has a wide range, from Vermont northward to Greenland, and west to California and Alaska. It occurs also in Europe and Asia. Related species grow in the peat bogs of the southeastern United States.

The specimen sketched was found in the Bow River Valley, sixteen miles west of Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

PLATE 198",NORTHERN BUTTERWORT,Pinguicula vulgaris Linnaeus,"Northern butterwort has a wide range, from Vermont northward to Greenland, and west to California and Alaska.

"SAN DIEGO MARIPOSA

Calochortus weedii Wood

The San Diego mariposa has a very restricted range, being confined to the desert regions of San Diego County, California, and adjacent Lower California. It loves the steep, dry slopes of the arroyos, where its long stems wave gracefully in the breezes that blow fitfully over the country. The grass-like leaves often turn brown before the flowers have opened. The San Diego mariposa differs from some of its Californian relatives in having its flower cups adorned with beard-like hairs grouped about the nectar gland at the base of each petal.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the outskirts of San Diego, California.

"BUFF MONKEYFLOWER

Diplacus longiflorus Nuttall

Buff monkeyflower is a plant of pleasing appearance. Its brightly colored flowers, borne in profuse clusters, are set off by their background of bright green foliage. This monkeyflower is a shrub, one to three feet high, delighting in the steep slopes of canyons, which are usually well drained. It is a sticky plant, and somewhat unpleasant to handle. Transplanted to garden soil, it grows more vigorously, and well repays the attention of the flower lover.

Buff monkeyflower grows in the southern half of California and in northern Lower California, at altitudes of 500 to 5,000 feet. It is a member of the Figwort Family, and by some botanists is placed in the genus Mimulus.

The specimen sketched was found about ten miles from Los Angeles, California.

PLATE 200",BUFF MONKEYFLOWER,Diplacus longiflorus Nuttall,"Buff monkeyflower grows in the southern half of California and in northern Lower California, at altitudes of 500 to 5,000 feet.","The specimen sketched was found about ten miles from Los Angeles, California.",200,200,42669662,California,USA
"LEMON COLUMBINE

Aquilegia flavescens Watson

All our native columbines are graceful plants with beautiful flowers, and the lemon columbine is one of the most attractive species. When, in midsummer, at the height of its blooming season, it appears everywhere over the mountain slopes, it affords fine displays of color. At this season the pale lemon-colored flowers are contrasted with large purple asters and other brilliantly tinted blossoms. The flower stems rise eighteen inches to three feet above the fernlike basal leaves. This species of columbine is frequently found at high altitudes, and here the dwarfed flower stems are often only six inches tall. In cliff crevices, with gray rock for a background, it makes entrancing pictures for those whose eyes observe nature’s wonderful harmonies.

Lemon columbine ranges from Wyoming to Oregon and north to Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the Ptarmigan Valley ten miles from Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"AVALANCHE-LILY

Erythronium montanum Watson

Mount Rainier National Park is celebrated among flower lovers for the abundance of this beautiful flower. As soon as the snow melts, and even before it entirely disappears, the sword-like leaves push through the sun-warmed earth and almost immediately the flower buds unfold. The plants grow so close together and in such vast numbers that the drier meadows and slopes are soon white with the flowers.

The avalanche-lily has a restricted range, being found only in Oregon and Washington. It is closely related to the golden glacier lily of the Rockies, and to the trout lily of the eastern United States.

The specimen sketched was collected near the hotel in Paradise Valley, Rainier National Park, Washington, at an altitude of 8,000 feet.

"QUEENCUP

Clintonia uniflora (Menzies) Kunth

Queencup is a lovely member of the Lily Family. It is found only in places where conditions are exactly to its liking, delighting in dense shade under the trees where mosses flourish and the earth is always cool and moist. The single flower stem rises between a pair of deep green leaves, similar to those of lily-of-the-valley, and bears a single pure white flower with yellow stamens.

Queencup ranges from Montana to California, and north to southeastern Alaska.

The specimen sketched grew near Emerald Lake, seven miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.

PLATE 203",QUEENCUP,Clintonia uniflora (Menzies) Kunth,"Queencup ranges from Montana to California, and north to southeastern Alaska.","The specimen sketched grew near Emerald Lake, seven miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.",203,203,42669665,British Columbia,Canada
"QUEENCUP

Clintonia uniflora (Menzies) Kunth

The fruit of the queencup is not easily found. Although the plants often form dense patches, and the leaves cover the ground thickly, only an occasional plant bears fruit. The berry is of an exquisite blue color, almost black, and is said to be poisonous, although its unpleasant flavor alone would probably prevent one from eating it.

Queencup is found from Montana to California and northward to southeastern Alaska.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the valley of the Kootenay River in British Columbia, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"CATALINA MARIPOSA

Calochortus catalinae Watson

Catalina mariposa is a gay member of the genus Calochortus, of which more than forty varieties are found in California. Its flowers are delicately colored, their pearly petals marked with lavender. In favorable situations, the plant may attain a height of two feet; in dry soil, although the stems are comparatively short, the flowers are still of normal dimensions, making them appear larger in proportion. Catalina mariposa grows in southern California, and on the adjacent islands. It was described originally from Santa Catalina Island. The mariposas, members of the Lily Family, are most abundant on the Pacific coast, but they range eastward to the Rocky Mountains and southward to the highlands of central Mexico. About fifty species are known. The name mariposa is the Spanish word for butterfly, and the plants are often called mariposa lilies.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Santa Ana, California.

"MEXICAN FREMONTIA

Fremontodendron mexicanum Davidson

Fremontia is quite unlike any other plant of the Pacific coast. It grows as a shrub or small tree with many branches. When the showy flowers first open they are bright yellow, but they soon fade to red and finally turn brown. The flowers remain on their stalks after they have withered, and a bizarre effect is produced by the various colors of flowers in different stages of development.

The genus Fremontodendron was named for General John C. Fremont, one of the early explorers of the West. The Mexican fremontia has a narrow range and is found only in southern California and northern Lower California. The only other species, Fremontodendron californicum, grows farther northward in the mountains of California.

The specimen sketched was grown in Los Angeles, California.

"PARTRIDGEBERRY

Mitchella repens Linnaeus

Partridgeberry grows in either dry or moist, partially shaded situations, forming deep green mats which creep closely over the ground. The leaves continue green throughout the winter. The sweet-scented flowers are often hidden beneath dry leaves strewn over the soil. They remind us of the blossoms of trailing-arbutus, though they always grow in pairs and not in clusters, like the flowers of that plant. The twin fruits frequently remain on the plant until spring, as in the specimen sketched. Grouse and quail are very fond of the bright red berries, which to our taste are insipid. This plant belongs to the Madder Family. It is easily cultivated in acid soil. The genus Mitchella was named in honor of Dr. John Mitchell, one of the earliest botanists of eastern Virginia, and a correspondent of Linnaeus.

Partridgeberry is found from Florida to Texas, and northward to Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Minnesota. It occurs also in the mountains of southern Mexico.

Our specimen was collected near Beaufort, South Carolina.

"MARSHMARIGOLD

Caltha palustris Linnaeus

When the marshmarigold is in full bloom and the frogs are singing in chorus, we realize that spring has really come. The wet meadows and the margins of the brimming streams are then adorned with bunches of this beautiful Caltha, whose flowers seem of a more brilliant gold because of the contrast with their surroundings. The cluster of bright green leaves, from which the flower stems rise, adds to the charm of the plant. The leaves in spring are as good as spinach when boiled as greens. The nectar is a feast for small bees and flies which visit the flowers in great numbers. The marshmarigold belongs to the Crowfoot Family. It is often erroneously called cowslip.

Marshmarigold has a wide range and may be found from South Carolina to Newfoundland and west to Nebraska and Saskatchewan. It occurs also in the Arctic regions, as well as in Europe and Asia.

The specimen sketched grew near Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.

"FOXGLOVE PENTSTEMON

Pentstemon digitalis (Sweet) Nuttall

Foxglove pentstemon thrives in dry meadows and thickets, and in midsummer its tall spikes of large white flowers, which are sometimes tinged with lavender, are very showy. Under cultivation, the size of the plant and the abundance of flowers may be improved. This is one of the few eastern pentstemons, most of the numerous members of the genus being natives of the western mountains. They belong to the Figwort Family, and are related to the garden foxglove. They are often called beardtongues.

Foxglove pentstemon ranges from Georgia northward to Maine, and westward to Arkansas and Illinois.

The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"BEAUTYBERRY

Callicarpa americana Linnaeus

Beautyberry is one of the common plants of the Southern States, growing in moist thickets or in dry, sandy places. It is a bushy shrub, sometimes as much as six feet tall. The small, bluish or pinkish flowers, appearing in spring in dense clusters in the axils of the leaves, are rather inconspicuous. In autumn, they are followed by bunches of juicy fruits of an unusual tint, making a large bush a magnificent sight. The fruits persist well through the winter, unless eaten by birds. This plant is a member of the Verbena Family, and is sometimes called French mulberry, apparently because of a remote resemblance of the fruit clusters to mulberries.

This native species is much more showy than the related Asiatic species, but is rarely cultivated. It occurs from Florida northward to Virginia and westward to Texas and Missouri.

"FIELD VIOLET

Viola rafinesquit Greene

The field violet is one of the daintiest members of the Violet Family. It prefers the drier fields and open woods, and because it so frequently is found growing in the grass, and has such a pale color, it is easily overlooked. Field violet is a winter annual, and growing day by day as the weather permits, it is one of the earliest violets to bloom in spring. It soon withers when the hot summer sun strikes it. It is more closely related to some of the European violets than to other American species, as shown by the large stipules at the base of the leaves. When freshly pulled the roots have the odor and taste of wintergreen.

Field violet extends from Georgia to Texas, and northward to New York and Michigan.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the National Zoological Park at Washington, District of Columbia.

"SPOTTED CYRTOPODIUM

Cyrtopodium punctatum (Linnaeus) Lindley

Few of the truly tropical orchids afford so brilliant a display of large and brightly colored flowers as does this plant, which is one of the showiest of all the orchids native in the United States. It grows abundantly in the cypress swamps of southern Florida, the huge plants with their large club-shaped pseudobulbs, often a foot long, forming dense clumps on the larger tree trunks. It is associated with smaller orchids, coarse ferns, bromeliads, and epiphytes of other groups. The graceful flower panicles, spreading or drooping from the tree trunks, are usually three feet long and sometimes much longer. The flowers, which recall those of the genus Oncidium, suggest a cloud of butterflies hovering over the foliage.

The spotted cyrtopodium has been in cultivation in England for a hundred years. Besides its occurrence in Florida, it has a wide range in the American tropics, extending through the West Indies and from Mexico to Brazil.

The specimen sketched was collected at Coot's Bay, Cape Florida, Florida.

"RED PINESAP

Hypopitys lanuginosa (Michaux) Nuttall

Because of its bright red color, red pinesap is more showy than some of its near relatives. Like them, it is a plant of fungus-like appearance, because of the complete lack of the green coloring which characterizes nearly all flowering plants. It grows in woodlands, springing from decayed vegetable mould. The plants develop and flower usually in rather late summer, but in the southern part of their range as early as June.

The red pinesap is widely distributed, being found from Florida to Louisiana, and north to Quebec and Newfoundland. It is sometimes referred to the same genus (Monotropa) as the Indianpipe.

The specimen sketched was collected near Washington, District of Columbia.

"SQUAWROOT

Conopholis americana (Linnaeus filius) Wallroth

Squawroot is a curious plant, suggesting in its appearance, because of the absence of green coloring, a fungus rather than a flowering plant. The thick and firm but fleshy stems often grow in dense clumps, the flowers nestling in the axils of bracts and forming a dense spike. The whole plant is pale yellow or brownish, and gradually withers to a deep brown, the stems persisting until late summer, when the seed pods are matured. It grows in rich woods, often about the bases of trees, the flowers opening as early as April.

Squawroot ranges from Florida and Alabama northward to Maine, Ontario, and Michigan. Another closely related species is native in the Southwestern States and in Mexico.

The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"RAGGED FRINGE-ORCHID

Habenaria lacera (Michaux) Loddiges

The ragged fringe-orchid comes into bloom a little later than its more showy sister, the yellow fringe-orchid. Because it grows in swampy places among grasses and other moisture-loving plants, or in deep woods, and since its flowers differ little in coloring from the leaves, it is not easily discovered. The stems are one to two feet high. The plant’s insect visitors are abundantly rewarded by the nectar which it supplies to them in exchange for the part they play in cross pollination. Owing to its color, it is more easily seen after dark than its yellow and purple relatives, and thus attracts night-flying moths to its feast.

Ragged fringe-orchid ranges from Georgia to North Carolina and Missouri, and northward to Newfoundland and Manitoba.

The specimen sketched was found near Washington, District of Columbia.

"RAMSHEAD LADYSLIPPER

Cypripedium arietinum Robert Brown

Ramshead ladyslipper is the rarest of the North American species of Cypripedium, and one of the most unusual in form and color. It is much daintier than its sisters in its habit of growth. It occurs only in cold, damp woods, and happy is he who is fortunate enough to find it.

Ramshead ladyslipper grows from Massachusetts and New York to Minnesota and northward to Quebec and Manitoba.

The specimen sketched was obtained in Chittenden County, Vermont, by Mr. Edwin Hale Lincoln of Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

"SHOWY LADYSLIPPER

Cypripedium reginae Walter

The showy ladyslipper is considered by many to be the most beautiful of our native species of Cypripedium. It loves peat bogs or low wet woods; thus only those willing to meet the difficulties of tramping in such places are rewarded by finding the shy beauty. Its flowers are also the largest of the North American ladyslippers, and it may have one or more blossoms to crown its leafy stem. The State of Minnesota has chosen the showy ladyslipper as its State flower, and it was the first of the States to adopt such an emblem.

The plant has a rather wide distribution, occurring from Georgia to Minnesota and northward to Newfoundland and Ontario.

The plant sketched was obtained by Mr. Edwin Hale Lincoln near Lenox, Massachusetts.

"ROSE POGONIA

Pogonia ophioglossoides (Linnaeus) Ker

Rose pogonia blooms at about the same time as the grass-pink orchid. It chooses the same swamps and wet meadows for its habitat, and the two are often found growing together. Its beautiful fringed lip is an enticing landing place for the bees, which are attracted also by the fresh raspberry odor of the flowers. Its roots are fibrous, and it propagates by runners as well as by seeds.

The plant has a wide range, extending from Florida to Texas and northward to Illinois, Minnesota, Ontario, and Newfoundland. It is found also in Japan.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Tuckerton, New Jersey.

"VENUS FLY TRAP

Dionaea muscipula Ellis

Venus flytrap is one of the most interesting and remarkable plants in the United States. The restricted region on the Atlantic coast in which it grows has been visited by many scientists bent upon forming a personal acquaintance with the plant in its native haunts. The white flower is inconspicuous. It is the leaves, which form a cluster at the base of the flower stems, that are so unusual. The leaves are produced at the base of the flower stalk, and consist of a flat stalk and a blade composed of two sides, like the leaves of a book. These are hinged to the midrib, and fringed on the outer edges with tiny spikes. On their concave faces, near the center, three or more tiny hair triggers are found. When these are touched, even lightly, the hinges close, and the insect visitor is clasped between the folded blades, while the spikes interlace firmly. No struggling insect can escape; it is so tightly held that the outline of its body can be seen through the leaf tissue. The leaf secretes a digestive substance, through whose agency the soft parts of the insect are absorbed by the cells. When this digestion is complete the leaf opens and releases the hard indigestible parts. Charles Darwin tells us that this is “the most wonderful plant in the world.”

Venus flytrap has a narrow range, occurring only on the coast of North and South Carolina, especially in the vicinity of Wilmington, North Carolina.

The sketch was made from a specimen grown in the greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture, in Washington, District of Columbia.

"CAROLINA JESSAMINE

Gelsemium sempervirens (Linnaeus) Persoon

Carolina jessamine, called “jasamer” by the natives of some parts of the South, is one of the delights of early spring in that region. It is a large vine whose woody, tangled, twining stems seek support upon the smaller trees, and then spread in riotous confusion over the tree tops. The clear yellow flowers are borne freely on the many leafy stems at the top, their delightful odor calling the bees to the feast of nectar spread for them. From the buds and seed pods an active medicinal preparation is made, but it must be used with care, as it is a narcotic poison.

Carolina jessamine is the State flower of South Carolina. It is found from Florida to Texas and northward to eastern Virginia, and grows also in Mexico. But one other species of the genus Gelsemium is known, which is a native of Asia.

The sketch was made from specimens gathered near Beaufort, South Carolina.

"MOUNTAIN-LAUREL

Kalmia latifolia Linnaeus

Mountain-laurel is a joy to the flower lover, not only when its beautiful blooms are plentiful in late spring, but also during the other months of the year, when its glossy evergreen leaves lend themselves so readily to the decoration of our homes. The intricate structure of the flowers is very curious. Each anther is tucked into a pocket on the inside of the corolla. When a bee probes the nectaries at the base of the flower tube the anthers are released and spring upward, emptying their pollen pouches upon the bee, which carries the pollen to the stigma of the next flower visited, thus effecting cross-pollination. The flower stalks are hairy and sticky and consequently entrap many ants and other small insects which are not useful in pollination. Honey made from mountain-laurel nectar is poisonous, and the leaves are deadly to stock. The heavy, hard, and tough wood is in demand for the manufacture of small articles. Mountain-laurel prefers sandy or rocky, acid soil. It frequently forms densely interlaced thickets and sometimes grows to a height of twenty feet. Rarely it is a tree as high as forty feet, with a trunk diameter of eighteen inches. Mountain-laurel was taken to Europe about 1750 by Peter Kalm, the Swedish explorer. He was a friend of Linnaeus, who gave the shrub the name Kalmia in his honor. It is the State flower of Connecticut.

Mountain-laurel extends from Florida to Louisiana, western Kentucky, and Indiana, and northward to Ontario and New Brunswick.

The sketch was made from a specimen obtained near Washington, District of Columbia.

"GOLDENCLUB

Orontium aquaticum Linnaeus

Goldenclub is not so handsome as many members of the Arum Family, but when the plants grow in large colonies their many bright yellow spikes are showy. Each spike is composed of innumerable tiny flowers. The plant attracts gnats and small insects, which are instrumental in fertilizing the flowers. It grows in open swamps and on the muddy borders of streams.

The range of the goldenclub is from Louisiana to Florida and northward to Massachusetts, chiefly near the coast.

The specimen sketched was procured near Beaufort, South Carolina.

"AMERICAN WATERLILY

Castalia odorata (Dryander) Woodville and Wood

The lure of ponds and shallow streams never seems more insistent than when the waterlilies open in the early morning. Thoreau, speaking of the Merrimac River, says, “I have passed down the river before sunrise on a summer morning, between fields of lilies still shut in sleep; and when at length, the flakes of sunlight from over the bank fell on the surface of the water, whole fields of white blossoms seemed to flash open before me, as I floated along, like the unfolding of a banner, so sensible is this flower to the influence of the sun’s rays.” Shelley also sings of their rare beauty:

**** floating waterlilies broad and bright,
Which lit the oak that overhung the ledge
With moonlit beams of their own light.

The fresh fragrance of these beautiful flowers is attractive not only to the flower lover but to the host of insects which visit them. The stamens and pistils mature at different times, thus cross-pollination is accomplished by the insect visitors. The flowers may be pure white, or tinged with pink. The leaves, shaded with maroon on the under side, are almost as beautiful as the flowers.

The American waterlily is found from Florida to Louisiana and Kansas, and northward to Newfoundland and Manitoba.

The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"SMOOTH YELLOW VIOLET

Viola ericocarpa Schweinitz

Among the host of violets, perhaps none is better known to the flower lover than this dainty yellow species, which grows so plentifully in its favorite habitat. A lover of low, open woods, it is early in bloom, and soon is past its full beauty.

Bryant alludes to one of the yellow violets when he tells us that
When beechen buds begin to swell
And woods the bluebird’s warble know
The yellow violet’s modest bell
Peeps from the last year’s leaves below.

The smooth yellow violet occurs from Georgia to Texas and northward to Nova Scotia and Manitoba, being thus somewhat more southern in range than its relative, the downy yellow violet.

The specimen sketched was obtained at Plummers Island in the Potomac River near Washington, District of Columbia.

"BOGBEAN

Menyanthes trifoliata Linnaeus

This lovely flower is well protected from molestation by admiring visitors, for it grows in cold swamps or such wet places that rubber boots are a necessity if good specimens are to be obtained. Usually, it is associated with thick beds of sphagnum. The white flowers, tinged with pink or purple and glistening in the sun, seem to vie with the bog orchids in beauty. The plant springs from a thick underground rootstock. It belongs to the small Bogbean Family, which is closely related to, and by many authors included in, the Gentian Family.

The range of the bogbean is wide, for it extends from New Jersey and West Virginia to Nebraska and California, and northward to Greenland and Alaska. It is found also in Europe and Asia.

The specimen sketched was collected in a cold bog near the motor road from Lake Louise to Moraine Lake, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,500 feet.

"YAUPON

Ilex vomitoria Aiton

Yaupon is a shrub or small tree, sometimes as much as twenty-five feet tall. It is especially handsome in autumn when covered with its beautiful red berries, which resemble those of its close relative, the American holly. It is worthy of wider cultivation as an ornamental plant in the Southern States. The fruits, when ripe, often do not remain long on the branches, for birds, especially mockingbirds, are very fond of the berries, and soon strip the trees of them. Various early explorers tell us of the black drink, or cassena, used by the Indians of the South Atlantic States, which was brewed from yaupon leaves. The dried leaves, which contain about one-half of one percent of caffeine, were steeped in water, which was then cooled by pouring rapidly from one vessel to another, this treatment producing frothiness. When very strong from long boiling, the liquid is black and bitter, and acts as an emetic, a quality which the Indians regarded lightly, and merely drank again. When, however, the leaves are heated with water for but a short time, a delicious drink is produced, and the United States Department of Agriculture is endeavoring to popularize this. It closely resembles maté or Paraguay tea, which is made from a related plant, and it promises to come into wider use as a substitute for tea, being more suitable than the latter for production under the labor conditions of this country.

Yaupon ranges along the Coastal Plain from Texas to Arkansas and Florida, and northward to Virginia.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Beaufort, South Carolina.

"TRUMPETCREEPER

Bignonia radicans Linnaeus

Trumpetcreeper is a hardy vine with strong growth, and with gaudy red to orange flowers clustered at the ends of long, graceful stems. If it has an opportunity it clings by means of aerial roots to a supporting neighbor, and frequently it climbs to the tops of tall trees. If no support is available it is satisfied to grow in moist fields, or on neglected roadsides. It is especially beloved by humming birds, which poise below the blossoms and thrust their long, slender bills into the trumpets to reach the nectar glands at the base. Audubon, in painting the ruby-throat, shows the bird with this flower. The trumpetcreeper belongs to the Bignonia Family, whose name was given by Linnaeus in honor of Abbe Bignon, librarian to Louis XV. The genus, as restricted by some authors, contains but two known species, the other being a native of Japan. The crossvine of the Southern States is a near relative. The Bignonia Family is a large one, but most of its representatives are confined to the tropics.

Trumpetcreeper ranges from Florida and Texas northward to southern New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Iowa.

The specimen sketched was found near Washington, District of Columbia.

"HIGHBUSH BLUEBERRY

Vaccinium corymbosum Linnaeus

Highbush blueberry is better known by its delicious fruit than by the beautiful flowers which are so attractive in spring. These are borne thickly on the branches and attract many insects to their nectar feast. But it is when loaded with fruit that the plant’s principal claim to our interest is acknowledged. While the wild berry is attractive, the improved varieties developed by Dr. Frederick V. Coville are our admiration and delight. The berries of these cultivated forms have reached seven-eighths of an inch in diameter. Highbush blueberries are grown in acid soils, and as they are very hardy, many waste places in our Northern States can be utilized to produce a crop of delicious fruit.

Highbush blueberry ranges, in its numerous forms, from North Carolina (and perhaps farther southward) westward to the Mississippi Valley, and north to Minnesota and Maine.

The specimen sketched was grown in the greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture in Washington from specimens obtained in New Jersey.

"BOX HUCKLEBERRY

The greatest development, it is known as “juniper.” Although the berries are rather insipid when eaten raw, they make delicious preserves. The range of the box huckleberry is from eastern Tennessee and probably northernmost North Carolina through the mountains of southern West Virginia and the western edge of Virginia. Isolated colonies, most if not all of them consisting of single plants, occur at two places in Pennsylvania, and one each on the Coastal Plain of Maryland and Delaware. These outlying plants have probably arisen from seeds carried by birds from the mountain colonies, a few hundred miles away. The New Bloomfield plant is estimated to be more than a thousand years old, and one of those near Losh Run, Pennsylvania, five to ten thousand years old.

The specimen figured was grown in a greenhouse of the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington.

"PINE LAND BLUEBERRY

Vaccinium tenellum Aiton

Pineland blueberry is a low shrub, rarely over three feet high. It has long, slender, woody underground stems, from which rise at irregular intervals the stiff, bushy branches. The flowers open in early spring, before the finely toothed leaves are fully expanded. The edible berries are a quarter of an inch in diameter, and black, with a whitish bloom over their surface.

Pineland blueberry ranges from Florida to Virginia and westward to Mississippi. It is a shrub of the Coastal Plain, and grows chiefly in sandy pine woods.

The sketch was made from specimens collected at Beaufort, South Carolina.

"CUCUMBERTREE

Magnolia acuminata Linnaeus

The cucumbertree is a handsome inhabitant of the eastern forests. Under favorable conditions it attains a height of ninety feet with a proportionately broad crown. The greenish-yellow flowers, in spite of their large size, are not so conspicuous as those of some other magnolias, for their color blends with that of the leaves. The cylindrical fruit, when ripe, is rose-colored, but before maturity, it is green, and bears some resemblance to a small cucumber. The wood is soft and yellowish brown.

This species has a wider range than most of the magnolias, extending from Georgia to Mississippi and Missouri and northward to New York and Ontario.

The specimen sketched was taken from a beautiful tree growing in front of the buildings of the Department of Agriculture in Washington, District of Columbia.

"DOWNY PINXTERBLOOM

Azalea rosea Loiseleur

Downy Pinxterbloom is a striking plant when in bloom, its masses of clear pink flowers attracting the attention of everyone. It decorates the landscape wherever it is found, and is especially beautiful as seen along narrow mountain roads. Here it grows in profusion in company with mountain-laurel and other acid-soil plants. It has a delightful odor. The shrub grows in a vigorous manner, and in favorable locations reaches a height of fifteen feet. It is often called erroneously honeysuckle. It is easily cultivated in suitable soils, and should be planted freely by those who love our native shrubs.

Downy Pinxterbloom extends from the mountains of Virginia westward to Missouri and north to New Hampshire and Southern Quebec.

The specimen sketched was brought into bloom in the greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture in Washington.

"SPOTTED BEEBALM

Monarda punctata Linnaeus

Spotted beebalm is one of the most beautiful members of the Mint Family. The delicate combination of color in its flowers is quite unlike the colors exhibited by most of its relatives. The plant has a strong flavor and scent, somewhat resembling that of mint but closer to that of thyme. It contains, in fact, so much of the valuable drug thymol that attempts have been made to grow it as a source of this substance. It grows mostly in dry, sterile, and often acid soils, being found in the Southern States in pine woods, though in the West it is frequent on prairies. It is sometimes called horsemint.

Spotted beebalm is distributed from Florida to Texas and Kansas and northward to southern New York and Minnesota.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Washington, District of Columbia, where it blooms throughout late summer.

"VIRGINIA SPRINGBEAUTY

Claytonia virginica Linnaeus

Springbeauty is one of the first spring flowers, blooming with hepatica, bloodroot, anemone, and trout lily. It grows from a small tuber, which is edible. The flowers open only in bright sunshine, closing at night and not opening again if the following day is cloudy. The three style branches of the pistil remain closely pressed together until the anthers have yielded their pollen to visiting insects; then the style branches spread to receive pollen from the later flowers. Longfellow alludes to the springbeauty in “Hiawatha,” telling us that
Where the fire had smoked and smoldered,
Saw the earliest flower of Spring-time,
Saw the Beauty of the Spring-time,
Saw the Miskodeed in blossom.

This species of springbeauty ranges from Georgia to Texas and northward to Nova Scotia, Montana, and Saskatchewan.

"PURPLE BUTTERWORT

Pinguicula elatior Michaux

Purple butterwort is a dainty and beautiful plant. It grows in moist sandy pine woods on the Coastal Plain, often in association with other purple or yellow butterworts. Although in Florida it may be found in flower at almost any season, it blooms most profusely in spring. The solitary flower is poised at the top of a slender stalk springing from the center of a rosette of pale green leaves, which usually lie flat against the sand. They feel greasy to the touch because they are covered with myriads of minute glands. The exudation from the glands entraps small insects which alight on the leaf surface, and these helplessly entangled creatures are held closely by the involled margins of the leaf blade, to be digested and assimilated as food. The butterworts are all terrestrial plants, but they belong to the same family as the bladderworts, many of which are aquatic. This species of butterwort is common in Florida and adjoining states, but appears to be unable to withstand cold weather. It has not migrated farther north than southern North Carolina. Curiously enough, one of its close relatives is intolerant of warm climates, and though occurring through much of Canada, has not reached farther south than central New York.

The specimen sketched was brought into flower in the greenhouses of the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, from specimens obtained in Florida.

"PARROT PITCHERPLANT

Sarracenia psittacina Michaux

Parrot pitcherplant is a beautiful member of the bizarre group to which it belongs. The Pitcherplant Family consists of only three genera and about ten species, all American. The true pitcherplants are all natives of the eastern United States, but one of their relatives grows in the mountains of California, and the other still farther away, in the mountains of Guiana. Our pitcherplants inhabit peat bogs, and they may be grown easily in the hot-house in a mixture of peat and sand. The pot should be placed inside a larger one, and the space between should be stuffed with peat moss, thus imitating the natural conditions of soil and moisture.

The parrot pitcherplant is one of the many interesting plants which are found on our southeastern Coastal Plain. It ranges from Florida to Georgia and Alabama.

The specimen sketched was grown in the greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture in Washington.

"WOOD SKULLCAP

Scutellaria serrata Andrews

This species is one of the most showy and beautiful of all the skullcaps, of which there are over sixty species in the United States. Its large, blue-purple flowers and the bright-green scentless foliage distinguish it from most other members of the Mint Family native in the Eastern States. It is a forest plant, apparently preferring soils of low acidity, forming small dense clumps, and flowering in May and June. Pink and white forms are occasionally found.

Wood skullcap ranges from South Carolina to Alabama and northward to New York and Illinois.

The sketch was made from a specimen found near Washington, District of Columbia.

"BLUE-EYED-GRASS

Sisyrinchium angustifolium Miller

The starlike flowers of blue-eyed-grass open only in bright sunshine, and last but a single day. Thus in fields that were plentifully sprinkled with them in the morning, not a flower will be found among the grasslike leaves and stems in the afternoon. Its leaves, although very slender, resemble those of an iris, being flattened and attached with their edges turned toward the stem. The plant is a member of the Iris Family.

This species of blue-eyed-grass has a wide range, from Virginia to Colorado and northward to Newfoundland and British Columbia. It has many close relatives, which can be distinguished from it only by botanists who have made a special study of this group.

The specimen sketched was gathered in the valley of Ghost River, thirty-five miles from Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"RED TRILLIUM

Trillium erectum Linnaeus

In one pronounced character the red trillium is strikingly different from other trilliums, which have no well-defined odor. The strong offensive odor of this plant is repellent to the bees and butterflies, although it does draw the carrion flies, which have a monopoly of the pollen shed by the anthers.

Red trillium ranges from North Carolina to Tennessee and northward to Nova Scotia and Ontario.

The plant sketched was procured from the National Zoological Park in Washington, District of Columbia.

"SNOW TRILLIUM

Trillium grandiflorum (Michaux) Salisbury

Snow trilliums are a delight to behold when they reach the perfection of growth in spring along with other early spring flowers. They love woodland regions, pushing up from the ground through the covering of brown leaves, and waving in every fitful breeze that blows. As the flowers fade they are flushed with a dainty pink color. Snow trilliums are easily grown and quickly spread through the woods when planted, needing no especial care. The soil must be rich, moist, and well-drained. The trilliums belong to the Lily Family.

The snow trillium has a rather wide range, extending from North Carolina to Missouri and northward to Minnesota, Ontario, and Quebec.

The sketch was made from plants grown near Washington, District of Columbia.

"SHOWY ORCHIS

Orchis spectabilis Linnaeus

Although this orchid is known by the English equivalent of its Latin name, showy orchis, the name is really not appropriate, for the plant is far less conspicuous than some of its North American relatives. It is known also as “pulpit-flower,” because of the resemblance of the mauve-colored arched petals to the sounding-board over a pulpit. In a walk through the deep woods in early spring, our feet rustling last year's fallen leaves, it is a pleasant surprise to chance upon a group of plants of this shy beauty, the earliest of the orchids to blossom.

The flower is well adapted to ensure cross-pollination by bumblebees, for not only is the lip or lower petal of just the size to enable these insects to get a good hold upon it, but the spur, at the bottom of which the nectar is contained, is exactly equal in length to the bumblebee's tongue, so that smaller insects cannot reach the nectar. Finally, the anther is so situated that while the bee is busily engaged in extracting the nectar, its head is smeared with the sticky pollen, and as the bee enters the flower of another plant, this pollen is rubbed off on the stigma, thus effecting cross-pollination. The waxy flowers are borne on a short stem, arising between two bright green leaves.

Showy orchis is found from Georgia to Arkansas, and northward to the Dakotas, Ontario, and New Brunswick.

The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"ROSEBUD ORCHID

Pogonia divaricata (Linnaeus) Robert Brown

Rosebud orchid is widespread and abundant in the far South, and the acid-soil meadows of northern Florida are sometimes colored pink by thousands of its blossoms. Farther north it becomes rarer, and is seldom found even by the botanist, whose excursions lead him to remote fields and bogs. The lovely shading and delicate penciling of the petals lend a peculiar charm to this orchid. To people not familiar with the book name, it is often known as the ""rosebud flower,"" because of the resemblance of the lip to a slender rosebud. Some botanists hold that it is not a true Pogonia, assigning to it the name Cleistes divaricata.

Rosebud orchid is found from Florida and Alabama northward to Kentucky and southern New Jersey, growing both in lowlands near the coast and on high mountains.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Beaufort, South Carolina.

"LARGE PURPLE FRINGE-ORCHID

Habenaria grandiflora (Bigelow) Torrey

Large purple fringe-orchid is perhaps the most beautiful of the Habenarias. The delightful fragrance of its flowers appeals to us no less than their beauty, and we are not surprised that they attract bees and moths to their nectar and pollen. The plant prefers moist or swampy places in grassy meadows or in partial shade, where the soil is distinctly, though not very strongly, acid.

Large purple fringe-orchid is found from the mountains of North Carolina northward to Newfoundland and Ontario.

The sketch was made from a specimen obtained on Mount Desert Island, Maine, where it grows abundantly.

"FRANKLINIA

Franklinia alatamaha Marshall

Franklinia, or Franklin tree, a member of the Tea Family, has perhaps the most romantic history of any plant included in “North American Wild Flowers.” It was first seen by John Bartram in 1765 in the vicinity of Fort Barrington, Georgia, and was named by his friend, Humphrey Marshall, in honor of Benjamin Franklin. His son, William Bartram, also visited the locality in 1791 and described the plant in his “Travels through North and South Carolina.” He states that he never saw it at any other place but near the Fort, where “there are two or three acres of ground where it grows plentifully.” Thorough search has since been made by botanists, including Dr. C. S. Sargent, H. W. Ravenel, and Dr. E. T. Wherry, but no wild plants can be found. All those in existence in American gardens apparently originated with the plant or plants obtained by William Bartram and grown at Philadelphia in the place long known as Bartram’s Garden, now a public park.

Franklinia has been shown by Dr. Frederick V. Coville to belong to the great number of plants that flourish only in acid soils. Cuttings have been rooted successfully and distributed to nurserymen and to private gardens. At Whitesbog, in New Jersey, a number of plants are growing vigorously under the care of Miss Elizabeth C. White. The specimen sketched was obtained from one of these plants when they were in blossom in September, 1926. The delicious odor of the flowers attracts many bees, but few viable seeds have resulted. The Franklinia blooms in autumn when most other trees or shrubs are past flowering. Its leaves turn a beautiful crimson before falling from the branches.

"BLUE PHLOX

Phlox divaricata Linnaeus

Blue phlox is a lovely flower of spring. It often grows in company with cream-white violets in rich valleys, beneath tall trees, affording a delightful combination of dainty color. In its wild state, this species of phlox is variable, the color ranging from pinkish to pale violet, and the corolla-lobes may be entire or deeply notched. It was one of the earliest American plants to be cultivated in Europe, being illustrated in Miller's “Figures of Plants” in 1758.

At Plummers Island, near Washington, District of Columbia, where the specimens sketched were obtained, visitors are not permitted to gather the flowers, and in consequence blue phlox has thrived and grows in great profusion, filling the woods with its fragrance. The plant is well adapted to cultivation in shady gardens.

Blue phlox is found from Florida to eastern Texas and northward to Quebec and Minnesota.

"BLUE-EYED MARY

Collinsia verna Nuttall

Blue-eyed-mary is one of the daintiest of spring flowers. In the Middle West, it sometimes grows in such profusion that the meadows are blue with its brightly colored blossoms. The plant is fragile in appearance. Its flowers, although without odor, are visited by many bees. A member of the Figwort Family, this plant is thus related to the snapdragons, penstemons, and monkeyflowers. It can be cultivated easily in rich, gravelly soil and is a very desirable addition to the wild garden. Since it is a winter annual, the seeds should be sown in summer or early fall, but once established, it reseeds itself abundantly.

The specimen sketched was grown by Dr. Edgar T. Wherry in his garden in Washington from seeds procured from Cincinnati, Ohio.

Blue-eyed-mary ranges from Western Pennsylvania to Kentucky and Kansas, and northward to western New York, Ontario, and Wisconsin.

"DUTCHMANS-BREECHES

Dicentra cucullaria (Linnaeus) Millspaugh

The peculiarly delicate flowers of dutchmans-breeches, held aloft above the lacelike leaves by a slender stem, are one of the delights of flower lovers in early spring. This plant prefers rich soil on rocky ledges or well-drained wooded slopes. The leaves wither when the warm days of late spring come. The plant was valued as a love charm by the North American Indians. Recent tests made by the United States Department of Agriculture trace many cases of stock poisoning to this plant. The leaves, unfolding before there is much other green vegetation, are eaten greedily by cattle, and since the plant grows in leaf mold, with slight hold in the earth, it is easily pulled loose, and the tubers as well as the leaves are eaten by the animal. This double dose of the toxic substance, which is contained in all parts of the plant, often produces fatal results. The Virginia highlanders know the plant as “little staggerweed.” It belongs to the Fumitory Family. Many authors use the name Dicentra for the genus. The flowers of this species are usually white, but pink-flowered plants are found occasionally, especially in the southwestern part of its range.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Washington, District of Columbia.

Dutchmans-breeches has a wide range, occurring from North Carolina to Kansas, and north to Minnesota and Nova Scotia.

"PEATPINK

Silene caroliniana Walter

The bright flowers of the peatpink are larger than the blossoms of most of our wild members of the Pink Family, and always attract notice among the spring flowers. The plants grow in clumps, and prefer dry, sandy or rocky, usually rather acid soil. The flowers have two sets of stamens, one set maturing before the other. The styles do not mature until the stamens have unloaded their pollen on visiting insects, which transfer it to the older flowers, thus ensuring cross-pollination. The flower stalks are sticky, so that small insects, endeavoring to reach the flowers by crawling up the stem, are trapped.

This species, termed in some books Silene pennsylvanica, ranges from Georgia to Massachusetts. A closely related species, differing in that the stems and calyx of the flowers are not sticky, grows from Alabama to Kentucky and has recently been named by Dr. J. K. Small, Silene wherryi.

The specimen painted was obtained at Washington, District of Columbia.

"CUT TOOTHWORT

Dentaria laciniata Muhlenberg

Cut toothwort is found in spring growing plentifully in rich, moist woods, at about the same time as bloodroot and hepatica. The name toothwort is given because of the protuberances on the rootstocks of some of the species of Dentaria. These rootstocks have a spicy flavor similar to watercress, and are enjoyed by country children, who know one of the species as “crinkleroot” and dig its rootstocks to eat with their school lunches. The pale pink or white flowers of cut toothwort are rather attractive, but the plant withers quickly when gathered, and does not easily revive.

This member of the Mustard Family is found from Florida to Louisiana and Kansas, and northward to Quebec and Minnesota.

The sketch was made from flowers gathered in Washington, District of Columbia.

"SWEET PITCHERPLANT

Sarracenia rubra Walter

Sweet pitcherplant is a lovely member of its family, its flowers held aloft on delicate stems well above the “pitchers.” In addition to other interesting features, it has a delightful odor similar to that of wild grape blossoms. The leaves have the usual characteristics of pitcherplants, catching and digesting unwary insects that enter them. Of all the pitcherplants, this is, perhaps, the most desirable to cultivate because of its fragrance and its lasting qualities. It should be grown in a cool greenhouse.

Sweet pitcherplant is found from Georgia and Alabama to North Carolina, growing chiefly at moderate elevations.

The specimen sketched was brought into bloom by Dr. Frederick V. Coville in the greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture in Washington, District of Columbia.

PLATE 250",SWEET PITCHERPLANT,Sarracenia rubra Walter,"Sweet pitcherplant is found from Georgia and Alabama to North Carolina, growing chiefly at moderate elevations.","The specimen sketched was brought into bloom by Dr. Frederick V. Coville in the greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture in Washington, District of Columbia.",250,250,42669092,District of Columbia,USA
"HOODED PITCHERPLANT

Sarracenia minor Walter

Hooded pitcherplant has some distinctive features not shown by most other members of the family. The hood is beautifully arched, and tends to darken the interior cavity of the leaf. Contrasting with the opaque yellow-green of the surrounding leaf structure, the translucent patches near the summit of the hood are white, and act as windows, transmitting light to the upper part of the “pitchers.” Insects encouraged by the light to enter are often unable to find the way out, and exhausted by their endeavors to escape, drop to the bottom of the “pitcher,” where they die and are digested for the use of the plant.

This is the southernmost in range of all the pitcher plants, occurring in damp, acid meadows as far south as the middle of the Florida peninsula, and ranging northward through eastern Georgia, but barely entering Alabama and North Carolina.

The sketch was made from plants collected near Beaufort, South Carolina.

PLATE 251",HOODED PITCHERPLANT,Sarracenia minor Walter,"This is the southernmost in range of all the pitcher plants, occurring in damp, acid meadows as far south as the middle of the Florida peninsula, and ranging northward through eastern Georgia, but barely entering Alabama and North Carolina.","The sketch was made from plants collected near Beaufort, South Carolina.",251,251,42669093,South Carolina,USA
"BOWMAN'S ROOT

Porteranthus trifoliatus (Linnaeus) Britton

The delicate flowers of bowman’s root grace the woodlands in June, when the graceful loose panicles of white blossoms, sometimes tinged with pink, are at their best. To the layman, the plant bears little resemblance to other members of the Rose Family, to which it belongs. The name Porteranthus was given in honor of Thomas Conrad Porter, professor of botany in Lafayette College. In many books, the plant is named Gillenia trifoliata.

Bowman's root ranges from Georgia to Missouri, and northward to New York, Ontario, and Michigan.

The plant sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"PINKSHELL AZALEA

Azalea vaseyi (Gray) Rehder

The pinkshell azalea is so charming in form and color that it deserves attention from flower lovers who cultivate our native plants. It prefers rather moist, acid soil, and yields easily to cultivation. The corolla is so different in shape from that of other Azaleas that it is considered by some botanists to belong to a distinct genus, named Biltia in honor of George Vanderbilt.

Pinkshell azalea has a narrow range, being found only at a few restricted localities in the mountains of western North Carolina. For many years nurserymen have been digging and shipping this species from its native haunts, until it has been nearly exterminated as a wild plant. Fortunately, it can be propagated in acid soils from seed.

The specimen sketched was grown by Dr. Paul Bartsch in his garden in Washington, District of Columbia.

"ROSEBAY RHODODENDRON

Rhododendron maximum Linnaeus

The glory of the rosebay rhododendron when in bloom can hardly be exaggerated. Its lovely white or delicately pink flower clusters, surrounded by dark green leaves, make a charming picture. The shrub grows to a height of thirty feet in the Carolina mountains, where it often covers every available spot, both swamp and hillside, with a tangle of stiff stems and leathery foliage. The mountaineers know it as “laurel.” Its roots lie in mats close to the surface of the ground, and are protected by a cover of fallen leaves, which conserve the moisture, retain the acid condition of the soil, and add fertility.

Rosebay rhododendron is the state flower of West Virginia. It is abundant from central Georgia and Alabama as far north as Pennsylvania. It is occasional farther north, even reaching one or two localities in Nova Scotia.

The specimen sketched was obtained from the mountains of North Carolina.

"ATAMASCO-LILY

Atamosco atamasco (Linnaeus) Greene

Springing from the brown bed of the southern forest, no lovelier flower graces the awakening of spring than the atamasco-lily, a member of the Amaryllis Family. Blooming as it does in many places about Easter time, it is widely known in the South as “Easter lily.” Great bunches of the flowers are gathered to decorate homes and churches, but since the bulbs are not disturbed, the plants are not injured. A few long grass-like leaves grow from the bulb, and above them the flower stem, bearing the beautiful white flower, which sometimes is shaded delicately with pale pink. The thrill that comes when the flowers are discovered for the first time will long be remembered, for a patch of moist open woods starred with hundreds of the blossoms is a beautiful sight.

Atamasco-lily ranges from Florida and Alabama northward to southeastern Virginia. It has been reported also from Pennsylvania, but has not been found in that state in recent years. By some botanists, the plant is known as Zephyranthes atamasco.

The flowers sketched were obtained near Yemassee, South Carolina.

"TURKSCAP LILY

Lilium superbum Linnaeus

It is not surprising that Linnaeus gave the specific name superbum to this beautiful lily. Anyone who has seen it growing in meadows or bogs in midsummer will never forget the impression created by a great number of these plants blooming together. The stems, which at times attain a height of seven feet, are crowned with a panicle of magnificent flowers, sometimes numbering forty, whose color varies from red to orange. This lovely wildling yields easily to garden treatment, especially in acid, boggy soil, and survives from year to year, even increasing in beauty.

Turkscap lily is found from the mountains of Georgia to Missouri, and northward to New Brunswick and Minnesota.

The flowers sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"ORANGE POLYGALA

Polygala lutea Linnaeus

At many places in the Southeastern States the brilliant heads of the orange polygala stand out in bold relief from the background of grasses and weeds that surround them. The pine-barren swamps are its chosen habitat, and here it may be found in blossom most of the summer. Most of the North American plants belonging to the Polygala Family have inconspicuous flowers, often dull in color, but the flowers of this species are very showy. The roots of the plant, like those of many other species of Polygala, contain the chemical substance commonly known as “oil of wintergreen,” which can be recognized by its odor and taste. As this same flavoring substance is used in candy, the country people throughout the South know the species of Polygala as “candyweed” or “candyroot,” and chew the roots as a cure for coughs and colds. The medicinal value of this species is slight, although extracts of the roots of other members of the genus are used extensively in cough remedies.

Orange polygala ranges from Florida and Louisiana northward to New Jersey and Long Island.

The sketch was made from flowers collected near Beaufort, South Carolina.

"RED HELMET

Pedicularis bracteosa Bentham

Red helmet, or wood betony, is found plentifully in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, and frequently, before it comes into bloom, deceives the passer-by, who assumes that its fern-like leaves are fern fronds. The flowers are curious in structure, the ""helmet"" having the shape of a walrus head with tusks on either side, and being so arranged that it protects the stamens from the rain. Insect visitors are plentiful, and gather the nectar easily from its shallow receptacles.

This member of the Figwort Family ranges from Colorado to California, and northward to Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was gathered near Baker Lake, fifteen miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"TURTLEHEAD

Chelone glabra Linnaeus

This plant prefers to grow along water courses or in swamps, where it blooms freely in late summer and fall. The ingeniously constructed flower is visited by bees and other insects. The lower lip forms a platform on which the bees alight, and as the hooded upper lip is large enough to enclose the body of any but the largest kind of bees, they usually disappear completely when they go in to get the nectar. When they back out, their heads bear pollen brushed from the anthers, and in entering another blossom they leave some of this on the stigma, thus effecting cross-pollination. The creamy color of the flower, sometimes tinged with pink, turns to brown as it fades. Turtlehead is easily cultivated and forms a desirable addition to the wildflower garden. It belongs to the Figwort Family, and is often known to country folk as “wild snapdragon.”

Turtlehead has a wide range, occurring from Florida and Alabama to Kansas, and north to Newfoundland and Manitoba.

The plant from which the sketch was made grew on Mount Desert Island, Maine.

"SCARLET ELDER

Sambucus pubens Michaux

Although rather inconspicuous in spring when its small, greenish-white flowers open, scarlet elder is a striking plant in summer and fall, with its bunches of brightly colored berries against a background of deep green leaves. The bushes are from five to thirty feet in height. Since they grow in rather barren, rocky places, and are not particular about soil or altitude, they have a wide distribution. The elders belong to the Honeysuckle Family.

This species is a rather northern one, ranging from the mountains of Georgia to those of Colorado and California, and northward to Newfoundland and Alaska.

The sketch was made from a specimen collected near Glacier House, Glacier, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"CROSSVINE

Anisostichus capreolatus (Linnaeus) Bureau

Although its flowers are very showy, crossvine is not familiar to many flower lovers. Its glossy, evergreen, pointed leaves are borne on tough, tangled, woody stems with stout tendrils. The plant is closely related to the trumpet-creeper, but is easily distinguished from it by the shorter trumpet of its flower. In some botanical works, it is listed as Bignonia crucigera, the species name meaning cross-bearer. In a section of the stem, certain elements of the wood make a perfect cross, hence the name crossvine. In autumn, the leaves turn to a bronze color. The crossvine prefers moist, almost swampy situations having an acid soil.

The plant ranges from Florida to Louisiana, and northward to Virginia, southern Ohio, and Illinois.

The specimen sketched was gathered near Beaufort, South Carolina.

PLATE 261",CROSSVINE,Anisostichus capreolatus (Linnaeus) Bureau,"The plant ranges from Florida to Louisiana, and northward to Virginia, southern Ohio, and Illinois.","The specimen sketched was gathered near Beaufort, South Carolina.",261,261,42669103,South Carolina,USA
"INDIANPIPE

Monotropa uniflora Linnaeus

The weird flowers of the Indianpipe develop in warm mid-summer weather after rains. The flowers rise above the forest floor when most plants are past their bloom. The plants subsist upon decaying vegetable matter, having a mat of rootlets under the dead leaves. They have specialized away from the habits of ordinary plants, having lost their chlorophyll, and are ghostly white, or sometimes pale pink, with leaves that are mere scales. As the seeds mature, the flowers turn upward and blacken.

This plant is very widely distributed, being found practically throughout the North American continent north of Mexico, and also in Japan and the Himalayas.

On Mount Desert Island, Maine, where this specimen was gathered, Indianpipe grew in many localities.

"CARDINALFLOWER

Lobelia cardinalis Linnaeus

Cardinalflower, one of the most brilliantly colored of all our wild flowers, loves swampy places or the banks of streams, where in mid-summer it reaches its perfection. The long spikes continue to bloom for weeks. The flowers open in succession from the lowest buds on the stem to those at the top. For this reason, the plant is easily exterminated in its native haunts, the flowers at the top of the stems being gathered with the old flowers and ripening seeds below. The color of the flowers is likened to that of a cardinal’s hat, and surely the corolla of no other of our wild flowers is so rich and velvety. Cardinalflower may be grown easily from seed, but in gardens it must be treated as a biennial unless its wet habitat can be reproduced. In the wild state, it is perennial by offsets.

Cardinalflower occurs from Florida westward to Texas, Kansas, and Colorado, and north to New Brunswick and Ontario.

The sketch was obtained from — gathered near Pocono Manor, Pennsylvania.

"ZENOBIA

Zenobia cassiniifolia (Ventenat) Pollard

Zenobia is a branching shrub, from three to five feet in height, with glossy, deep green leaves. Its clusters of large, creamy-white, bell-shaped flowers exhale a delightful perfume, and its name is a fitting tribute to the beautiful Zenobia, queen of Palmyra, in the days of its glory. The plants flourish in acid soil, like most other members of the Heath Family, to which the genus belongs.

Zenobia ranges from Florida to North Carolina, in the coastal plain and piedmont provinces, but it has proved hardy much farther north.

The sketch was made from specimens obtained near Rose Hill, North Carolina.

"AMERICAN MISTLETOE

Phoradendron flavescens (Pursh) Nuttall

The mistletoe of romance does not grow in America, but our native species serve the same decorative purpose and are used at Christmas time with holly and other evergreens. There are several kinds of mistletoe, parasitic on both evergreen and deciduous trees. The name Phoradendron, applied to the principal American genus of the Mistletoe Family, is derived from Greek words meaning “tree-thief.” Where American mistletoe is plentiful, it often kills its host. The flowers appear in September, but the fruit does not mature until the following year. Each berry contains a single seed.

This species of mistletoe is found from Florida to Texas and Missouri, and northward to New Jersey and Ohio.

The sketch was made from a specimen obtained in Virginia, where it grows chiefly on tupelo trees, but sometimes on red maples.

"AMERICAN HOLLY

Ilex opaca Aiton

The brilliant red berries and spiny evergreen leaves of American holly carry with them all the Old World associations, even though our species is different from that of Europe. The inconspicuous flowers are of a greenish color, and the pistillate and staminate florets usually occur on separate trees. American holly is most abundant in moist woods on rather acid soils. It sometimes reaches a height of fifty feet, with a trunk three and a half feet in diameter, but is of slow growth. The wood is white, close-grained, and hard; the bark greenish gray, with white markings. The great demand for holly at Christmas stimulates cutting for commercial purposes, and is denuding the forests of this beautiful evergreen. To save it from extermination, substitutes must be used whenever possible.

American holly is found from Florida to Texas and Missouri, and northward to Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts.

The sketch was made from a specimen obtained near Washington, District of Columbia.

"MOUNTAIN HEMLOCK

Tsuga mertensiana (Bongard) Sargent

Mountain hemlock forms wide expanses of dark green foliage along the mountain sides. A mature tree has a tapering trunk two to four feet in diameter and seventy to a hundred feet in height, and gracefully drooping branches. The heavy cones are abundant and beautifully colored, especially in their earlier stages, before the scales have dried in ripening. In the Selkirk Mountains this is a conspicuous tree, adding greatly to the beauty of the landscape.

Mountain hemlock has a comparatively narrow range, occurring from western Montana to California and Alaska.

The specimen sketched grew near Glacier House, Glacier, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"WESTERN HEMLOCK

Tsuga heterophylla (Rafinesque) Sargent

Western hemlock is a tall tree with graceful feathery branches, quite different from the mountain hemlock in habit and in fruitage. It sometimes grows two hundred feet high, with a trunk six to nine feet in diameter. The small brown cones, not more than an inch long, are produced abundantly, and contrast with the background of shiny, dark green leaves. The leaves are marked on the lower surface with white bands.

This species of hemlock occurs from western Montana to northern California, Alberta, and Alaska.

The specimen was obtained at Glacier House, near Glacier, British Columbia, at an elevation of 3,500 feet.

"WESTERN LARCH

Larix occidentalis Nuttall

One of the stateliest trees in our northwestern country is western larch, which gives a distinctive appearance to the forests where it is found. The tall, straight trunks, often three feet in diameter, reach a height of a hundred feet or more, rising above the surrounding trees. The wood is very durable, which makes it especially suitable for railroad ties. In consequence, the large trees are being cut rapidly.

Western larch ranges from western Montana to Oregon and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the valley of the Horse Thief River, a tributary of the Columbia River in British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.

"DOUGLAS-FIR

Pseudotsuga mucronata (Rafinesque) Sudworth

The giant Douglas-fir is an impressive tree wherever it reaches its full development. It grows from eighty to two hundred feet in height with a trunk two to eight feet in diameter, or sometimes even larger. The rich green foliage, pointed buds, and beautiful pendent cones distinguish it from its forest companions. The long bracts are conspicuous on the cones, since they extend half an inch beyond the scales.

Douglas-fir is found from western Texas and northern Mexico to California, British Columbia, and Alberta.

The sketch was made from a specimen obtained near Radium Hot Springs in the Columbia River Valley, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.

"BUNCHBERRY

Cornus canadensis Linnaeus

To see bunchberry in its glory we must travel to the northern woods, where the cool summers and generally moist conditions of soil and atmosphere are most favorable to its growth. Here it covets acid humus with its bright green leaves, producing at the top of each stem a whorl of pointed, white, petal-like bracts. The flowers proper are the few inconspicuous purple or greenish tubular objects clustered in the center of these bracts. Bunchberry is closely related to the showy dogwood trees of more southern regions and in its way is quite as beautiful, in spite of its small size.

Bunchberry has a wide range, being found from the mountains of West Virginia and New Jersey to Maine and Labrador, and westward to Colorado, California, and Alaska.

The specimen sketched was gathered at Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

Cornus canadensis Linnaeus

When in August the bunchberry is in fruit, it is even more striking than when in flower, for the berries are exceptionally brilliant in color. They are relished by wild birds, though insipid and unattractive to our taste. Both stems and leaves also turn red, enhancing the charm of the bunchberry's home, in the shady places of the deep northern forest.

Owing to the wide range of the bunchberry, it is well known to flower lovers everywhere. From West Virginia to New Jersey it grows only on the higher mountains, but it descends to sea level from Massachusetts to Labrador. It is common also in the mountainous regions of western North America from Colorado and California to Alaska.

The sketch was made from a specimen collected near Hector, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.

"WOODNYMPH

Moneses uniflora (Linnaeus) Gray

Woodnymph would probably escape the attention of the passerby, were it not for the pervasive odor of its flowers. Beautiful trails in the deep forest, where the sunshine filters through, lead us to the quiet spots where it grows in perfection. Half hidden by surrounding moss, with the stem turned down so that the flower is shielded from rain, it is seen only by sharp eyes. After fertilization the stem straightens, turning the flower upward.

Woodnymph constitutes a genus of its own and belongs to the Pyrola Family—in fact, it is often known as the “one-flower pyrola.” It has a wide range, occurring from the mountains of Pennsylvania to Labrador, and from New Mexico northward to Oregon and Alaska, as well as in Europe and Asia.

The specimen sketched was gathered in the valley of Baker Creek, twenty miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"ALBERTA PRIMROSE

Primula maccalliana Wiegand

Travelers to the mountains in midsummer rarely see this lovely primrose, for it soon passes with the first warm days. It delights in wet banks or moist, sandy or gravelly places, and is so small that sharp eyes are needed to find it. The slender, dainty stem carries the pale pink flowers four or five inches above the basal tuft of green leaves, from whose center they spring. The flowers become purple in withering.

Alberta primrose has a narrow range, occurring only in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was found on the shore of Bow Lake, twenty-five miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"MOURNING GROUNDSEL

Senecio lugens Richardson

Mourning groundsel is a peculiar plant, thriving in situations where camps have been located, and blooming late in the flowering season. The flower stalk, about a foot tall, rises from the center of a rosette of large leaves, and from the top of the stem a half dozen flowers on long stems sprawl irregularly. The name commemorates a massacre at Bloody Falls on the Coppermine River in Yukon, within the Arctic Circle, where a party of Eskimos was destroyed by Northern Indians who accompanied the explorer Hearne.

The range of mourning groundsel is from Montana and Washington northward to Yukon.

Our sketch was made from a specimen found on the upper Pipestone River, fifteen miles northwest of Lake Louise, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"SLENDER SHOOTINGSTAR

Dodecatheon pauciflorum (Durand) Greene

Slender shootingstar has a delicate habit of growth, and appears so frail that one wonders how it thrives in its chosen location. It loves moist places, such as wet meadows, or rocky ledges where cold water trickles down. The stems rise from the center of a loose tuft of green leaves. The flowers always remind us of the cyclamen, and this is not surprising, as both belong to the Primrose Family.

The range of slender shootingstar is rather wide, from Colorado northward to Saskatchewan, Mackenzie, British Columbia, and Alaska.

The sketch was made from a specimen found in the valley above Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,500 feet.

PLATE 276",SLENDER SHOOTINGSTAR,Dodecatheon pauciflorum (Durand) Greene,"The range of slender shootingstar is rather wide, from Colorado northward to Saskatchewan, Mackenzie, British Columbia, and Alaska.","The sketch was made from a specimen found in the valley above Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,500 feet.",276,276,42669118,Alberta,Canada
"SNOW WILLOW

Salix nivalis Hooker

When climbing in the higher altitudes of the Rocky Mountains, just above timber line, one often finds large patches of the ground covered with a low plant about an inch high, bearing spikes of tiny red flowers surrounded by small, dark green leaves. It proves to be the snow willow, one of the smallest of all the large group of willows. Later in the season, the flowers are followed by tiny seeds with feathery appendages, by means of which they are carried by the wind to new locations far from the parent plants. The plant is so low that it is not torn by the winds, however violent they may become on the bleak mountain slopes. In winter, also, it is well protected by even the thinnest blanket of snow. Thus has the tiny willow become adapted to its environment.

The species ranges from Montana to Washington, and northward to Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was found near Bow Lake, twenty-five miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

PLATE 277",SNOW WILLOW,Salix nivalis Hooker,"The species ranges from Montana to Washington, and northward to Alberta and British Columbia.","The specimen sketched was found near Bow Lake, twenty-five miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.",277,277,42669119,Alberta,Canada
"GRAY PHACELIA

Phacelia sericea (Graham) Gray

Gray phacelia grows under various conditions in the higher mountains. Some plants are quite low, others form stems a foot tall, springing from a bunch of silky gray-green leaves. The flowers are produced in elongated clusters. The deep purple color of the flowers contrasts with the bright yellow of the anthers, which stand out on filaments much longer than the corolla, giving a feathery appearance to the spikes. Numerous insects are attracted by the strong, disagreeable odor. Gray phacelia belongs to the Waterleaf Family and ranges from Colorado and Nevada northward to Alberta and British Columbia.

The sketch was made from a specimen collected near Glacier, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

"NODDING CAMPION

Lychnis apetala Linnaeus

Nodding campion grows among the rocks and boulders of old moraines or on alpine summits. Its flowers, turned toward the ground, are inconspicuous. The tiny petals project only a little from the end of the inflated calyx. Though the species has a wide distribution, it is seldom seen by the traveler because the coloring of both leaves and flowers is similar to that of the rocks among which it grows.

Nodding campion is found in both Labrador and Greenland, and extends from Colorado and Utah northward to Alberta, British Columbia, and Alaska. It occurs also in Europe and Asia.

The sketch was made from a specimen found near Lake McArthur, fourteen miles by trail from Hector, British Columbia, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

"GOLDEN FLEABANE

Frigeron aureus Greene

Golden fleabane is known to all mountaineers in the Canadian Rockies, for its clear yellow flowers cover the ground in favorable situations above tree line, or appear in rock crevices where the soil has gathered in sufficient quantity to give the plants a foothold. The flowers spring from a tuft of gray-green leaves, and are raised by their tiny stems an inch or more above the ground. They are not so perishable as most alpine flowers, and may be found through most of the season. They belong to the Aster Family.

Golden fleabane has a narrow range, being found only in Alberta and British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was obtained on the summit of Mount Fairview, near Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 8,500 feet.

PLATE 280",GOLDEN FLEABANE,Frigeron aureus Greene,"Golden fleabane has a narrow range, being found only in Alberta and British Columbia.","The specimen sketched was obtained on the summit of Mount Fairview, near Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 8,500 feet.",280,280,42669122,Alberta,Canada
"GOLDEN SEDGE

Carex aurea Nuttall

Sharp eyes are needed to find this attractive sedge in fruit, for it grows near the ground among other grasses and plants. Its seeds are heavy in proportion to the slender stems, and the bunches are borne over toward the ground. We have frequently found it on the flats of glacier-fed streams, where the hot mid-day sun melted the ice and sent down a flood of water every afternoon.

Golden sedge has a wide range, being found from Pennsylvania and Connecticut to Newfoundland, and westward to New Mexico and California and northward to Yukon.

The specimen sketched was obtained at Lone Pine Camp, in the valley of the Siffleur River in Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

PLATE 281",GOLDEN SEDGE,Carex aurea Nuttall,"Golden sedge has a wide range, being found from Pennsylvania and Connecticut to Newfoundland, and westward to New Mexico and California and northward to Yukon.","The specimen sketched was obtained at Lone Pine Camp, in the valley of the Siffleur River in Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.",281,281,42669123,Alberta,Canada
"ALPINE POINTVETCH

Oxytropis podocarpa Gray

Rocky slopes above timberline yield many of the most attractive flowers, among them the alpine pointvetch. This plant overcomes the handicaps of its difficult environment by growing close to the ground, its woody root holding it firmly to the soil that has collected among the stones or in the crevices of rocky ledges. The gray-green leaves form a fine background for the comparatively large purple flowers, which also lie near the ground.

Alpine pointvetch belongs to the Pea Family. It occurs from Colorado to Idaho, and northward to British Columbia and Alaska, also in Labrador.

The sketch was made from a specimen collected at Wonder Pass, near Mount Assiniboine, fifty miles south of Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 8,000 feet.

PLATE 282",ALPINE POINTVETCH,Oxytropis podocarpa Gray,"Alpine pointvetch occurs from Colorado to Idaho, and northward to British Columbia and Alaska, also in Labrador.","The sketch was made from a specimen collected at Wonder Pass, near Mount Assiniboine, fifty miles south of Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 8,000 feet.",282,282,42669124,Alberta,Canada
"ALPINE POINTVETCH

Oxytropis podocarpa Gray

Alpine pointvetch is adorned, a little later in the season, with inflated pods. As the slender stems are unable to bear their weight, the pods lie on the ground, and sometimes, if the plant is especially sturdy, make a circle of fruit around the gray silky leaves. The tiny peas soon ripen, and finding lodgment in some cranny among the stones and rocks, produce new plants.

We find this member of the Pea Family in Labrador, and in the west from Colorado and Idaho northward to British Columbia and Alaska.

The specimen sketched was collected near Bow Lake, twenty-five miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,800 feet.

PLATE 283",ALPINE POINTVETCH,Oxytropis podocarpa Gray,"We find this member of the Pea Family in Labrador, and in the west from Colorado and Idaho northward to British Columbia and Alaska.","The specimen sketched was collected near Bow Lake, twenty-five miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,800 feet.",283,283,42669125,Alberta,Canada
"ROCKY MOUNTAIN KALMIA

Kalmia microphylla (Hooker) Heller

The dainty stems and flowers of Rocky Mountain kalmia cause that plant to seem far removed from its sturdy relatives of the eastern United States. It grows in swampy places near streams and alpine lakes, often forming masses of color among the moss, grasses, and other low-growing plants which love similar conditions of soil and moisture. The first hot days cause the corollas to fall, leaving behind them a cluster of red seed vessels. Rocky Mountain kalmia belongs to the Heath Family and is closely related to Rocky Mountain cassiope, as well as to the pink and the white mountain-heathers, which often grow near it in somewhat drier soil.

Rocky Mountain kalmia has a comparatively narrow range, occurring from Colorado west to California, and northward to Alberta, British Columbia, and Alaska.

The specimen sketched was collected at Burgess Pass, seven miles by trail from Field, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

"SIDEBELLS PYROLA

Pyrola secunda Linnaeus

Sidebells pyrola—its name often contracted to sidebells—is a dainty plant, with small, leathery leaves close to the ground. It loves moist shady places. The tiny bell-shaped flowers hang from one side of the flower stem, and by this characteristic the species is easily distinguished from the other pyrolas. It seems easily satisfied with respect to habitat, for we find it growing plentifully in widely different situations, although always in rather acid soil.

This diminutive relative of the heaths has a wide range, occurring from Virginia to California and Mexico, and northward to Alaska and Labrador. It is found also in Europe and Asia.

The sketch was made at Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, where the specimen grew at an altitude of 5,500 feet.

"PINK PUSSYTOES

Antennaria rosea (Eaton) Greene

Of all the kinds of Antennaria, pink pussytoes is one of the most attractive, the pale silvery leaves and stems and the pink bracts of the flower heads forming a pleasing color combination. The plants are found usually in dry sterile or moist open ground, where they form mats, often in association with Antennaria microphylla, a similar species.

Pink pussytoes belongs to the Aster Family, and ranges from Colorado to California and Yukon.

The specimen shown was collected at an altitude of 6,000 feet, near Lake Agnes, reached by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada.

"ELKSLIP

Caltha leptosepala De Candolle

The traveler seldom sees the beautiful elkslip in perfection, because it frequents retired spots high in the mountains. It grows in dense masses, preferring swampy meadows wet by the cold water from melting snow. The leaves suggest those of the cyclamen, but the flowers, with their yellow centers and white petals, are more like the flowers of bloodroot. Sometimes the petals are tinged outside with pale blue. They soon fall when the hot sun strikes them.

Elkslip has a wide range, occurring from New Mexico to Washington, Alberta, and British Columbia. It belongs to the Crowfoot Family and is closely related to the marsh marigolds of the East.

Near Mount Assiniboine, where this specimen was collected at an altitude of 5,000 feet, the alpine meadows in places are covered with its sturdy growth. Mount Assiniboine is fifty miles by trail south of Banff, Alberta, Canada.

"ROCK WORMWOOD

Artemisia discolor Douglas

The wormwoods all have a pungent odor, especially when the leaves and flowers are crushed. Rock wormwood grows among the loose stones of steep rock slides. The plants are so nearly the color of their rock surroundings that they are easily overlooked. The wormwoods belong to the vast Aster Family, and to the subdivision that includes the oxeye daisy and yarrow.

Rock wormwood has a narrow range, being found from Montana to Washington, and northward to British Columbia.

The specimen sketched was obtained by the side of the rocky trail under Mount Wapta, ten miles by trail from Field, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

"PEARL EVERLASTING

Anaphalis margaritacea (Linnaeus) Gray

Pearl everlasting, with its clusters of yellow-centered white flower heads, grows plentifully in many situations, but it is not one of the most beautiful of the mountain flowers. The white, cottony leaves and stems contrast with the background of dark green grasses and leafy plants among which the plants grow. The flowers are sometimes dried for winter use in making wreaths and other decorations, and they are often dyed red for use at Christmas. The plant belongs to the Aster Family.

Pearl everlasting has a wide range, being found from Pennsylvania to Kansas and California, and northward to Newfoundland and Alaska. It occurs also in Asia.

The specimen sketched was gathered near Moose Creek, in the valley of the Kootenay River, forty miles southwest of Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"ALASKA FLEABANE

Evigeron salsuginosus (Richardson) Gray

Of all the mountain flowers in the Canadian Rockies, Alaska fleabane is one of the most conspicuous on the higher slopes and in the alpine valleys. The flower heads are large, their bright yellow centers surrounded by purple rays. The stems are often eighteen inches tall. Growing in profusion, frequently with lemon columbine, they make the slopes gay with their colors. The horses apparently enjoy their flavor, and always try to nip them along the trail.

The range of this fleabane is from New Mexico to California, and northward to Alaska and Saskatchewan.

The sketch was made at Tilted Mountain Camp, eighteen miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.

"GLOBE ANEMONE

Anemone globosa Nuttall

This beautiful flower is often the first anemone seen by the flower lover whose Western journey is taken in midsummer, when the early anemones are past flowering. The plants grow in clumps, the flowers borne on stout stems well above the gray-green foliage and colored pink, red, white, or sometimes lavender. A thimble-like seed-head follows the flowers, and this soon develops into a fluffy mass, each seed being provided with cottony hairs by which the wind transports it to a new location. The anemones belong to the Crowfoot Family.

Globe anemone occurs from New Mexico and California northward to South Dakota, Mackenzie, and Alaska. It is very plentiful in some of the dry meadows near Banff.

The sketch was made from specimens gathered near Mt. Massive, ten miles west of Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"SHORTSPUR COLUMBINE

Aquilegia brevistyla Hooker

Shortspur columbine is a rare member of the Crowfoot Family, seldom found by mountain visitors. Its blue coloring is most beautiful, and in marked contrast to that of the lemon columbine and red columbine, both of which are familiar plants in the alpine valleys of the Canadian Rockies.

This species is found from Minnesota and South Dakota to Alberta and Yukon. It is closely related to the European columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris) so often cultivated in our gardens.

The sketch was made from a specimen obtained in the valley of Healy Creek, ten miles south of Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"RED DEWBERRY

Rubus pedatus Smith

The rich green leaves of the red dewberry form close mats over the ground, and the star-like white flowers contrast sharply with them. The fruits have usually four or five drupelets, bright red in color, surrounded by a leafy envelope. The stems creep along the ground, rooting at the joints. Both flowers and fruits often are found on the plants at the same time. This member of the Rose Family inhabits cool, damp woods.

In the Selkirk Mountains, red dewberry is very plentiful, but our specimen was obtained near the trail leading from the Banff-Windermer motor road at Marble Canyon to Evelyn Glacier, five miles south, in the valley of Vermilion River, fifteen miles from Castle Station on the Canadian Pacific Railway, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"LADDER GENTIAN

Gentiana acuta Michaux

Ladder gentian is not so handsome or showy as many other gentians. The stems are stiff and frequently dark red in color. The numerous flowers are lavender or sometimes white, and spring from the stem in the axils of the upper leaves. Often the plants are almost pyramidal in form, especially when growing among other plants in full sunshine in upland meadows. This species prefers rather dry, sandy soil, and as the roots are very shallow, the plants are easily pulled up.

Ladder gentian ranges from New Mexico to California and north to Alaska, and from Maine to Labrador. It is found also in Europe and Asia.

The sketch was made from a specimen secured near Lake Louise Station, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"ALPINE MILKVETCH

Astragalus alpinus Linnaeus

Alpine milkvetch is found at high altitudes. It covets the ground with a mat of leaves, above which the loose bunches of delicate mauve flowers are borne in short heads. It delights in rocky soil in partially shaded situations. When found above tree line, the flower heads are borne on very short stems. The flowers show the plant to be a member of the Pea Family.

Alpine vetch has a wide range, being found from Vermont to Labrador, and from Idaho to Alaska. It occurs also in Europe.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the valley of Johnson Creek, thirty miles by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"GRAYLEAF FIVEFINGER

Potentilla glaucophylla Lehmann

On the higher mountain slopes we were always attracted by the cheerful yellow flowers of grayleaf fivefinger. The slender stems, rising well above a bunch of gray-green leaves, wave to and fro in the mountain breezes. The blossoms seem sometimes almost like a shower of gold, just reaching the earth from the clouds above. This plant belongs to the Rose Family.

Grayleaf fivefinger ranges from New Mexico to Oregon, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan.

The sketch was made at Lake O'Hara, eleven miles by trail north of Hector Station on the Canadian Pacific Railway, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"GOLDENPEA

Thermopsis rhombifolia (Nuttall) Richardson

The clear yellow flowers of the goldenpea, as observed from the cat windows, are very striking, and they are equally beautiful when seen close at hand. The plant’s suggestion of coarseness is less apparent when the blooms are gathered to adorn the house, and they do not fade so quickly as many of the daintier flowers.

Goldenpea has a rather wide range, extending from Colorado and Nebraska northward to Saskatchewan.

The specimen sketched was obtained near Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"WESTERN MENZIESIA

Menziesia glabella Gray

Many of the steep wooded slopes in the higher valleys of the Northwest Coast are covered with blueberry bushes and other shrubs, and in company with them is found the western menziesia, sometimes called false blueberry. The dainty bells, hanging from the upper portions of the bushes, are tinged with vermilion or pink. When the leaves and stems are crushed, an unpleasant skunk-like odor is very evident. The ponies never eat the bush, and so escape the effects of the poison that this plant has recently been proved to contain. The flowers soon wither when hot days come, and are followed by curious little seed vessels. The genus name was given in honor of its discoverer, Archibald Menzies, one of the earliest botanists to visit the Northwest Coast.

The genus Menziesia belongs to the Heath Family. The species ranges from Wyoming to Oregon, British Columbia, and Alberta. It has a relative also in the Appalachian Mountains.

The sketched branch was obtained on the side of the Yoho Valley, near Field, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

"YELLOW WILLOW-WEED

Epilobium luteum Putsh

The lush growth of yellow willow-weed attracts attention to the plant, as its greenish-yellow funnel-shaped flowers are inconspicuous. It loves the moist borders of streams, or other wet places. The long seed pods are characteristic of the Epilobiums, a well-known genus of the Evening-primrose Family. This species has a narrow range, being found from Washington State and British Columbia to Alaska.

Yellow willow-weed grows plentifully in the Selkirk Mountains near Glacier House, at Glacier, British Columbia, where this specimen was gathered at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"FIREWEED

Epilobium angustifolium Linnaeus

The magenta hue of fireweed is often inharmonious with the colors of other flowers, but when seen alone in valleys or on mountain sides, tinting the landscape, it is very beautiful. The tall, graceful stems are decorated with many flowers, and these are followed by the cottony seeds which are blown everywhere by the passing winds. After forest fires, fireweed is the first plant to cover the burns, and its name was derived from this fact. Occasionally the flowers are white or very pale pink. Where the soil is especially rich, the plant may grow to a height of five or six feet. It belongs to the Evening-primrose Family.

Fireweed has a wide range, occurring from North Carolina to Greenland, and westward to New Mexico, California, and Alaska. It is found also in Europe and Asia.

The specimen sketched came from the valley of the Clearwater River, thirty miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"BEARGRASS

Xerophyllum tenax (Pursh) Nuttall

Beargrass is a conspicuous plant when in bloom, the spikes of creamy flowers contrasting with the dark green foliage of the neighboring trees and plants. The numerous flowers seem almost too heavy even for the stout stems supporting them. On steep slopes, sterile plants often form a close swath, which is so slippery that it is difficult to traverse. The tender young flower shoots are eaten by bears, and are also cut down by ground squirrels for food. The Indians use the leaves in making fine baskets, and for this reason the plant is sometimes known as “basketgrass.” The genus contains only two other species, one of which, known as “turkey’s beard,” is found on the Atlantic coast.

Beargrass belongs to the Lily Family. It has a narrow range, occurring only from Montana and California to British Columbia. It is especially plentiful in Glacier National Park.

The specimen sketched was obtained in Mount Rainier National Park.

"PINK CENTAURIUM

Centaurium venustum (Gray) Robinson

The brilliant flowers of pink centaurium contrast beautifully with their gray surroundings, and are the more striking because the plants grow in bunches. The numerous flowers are large in proportion to the size of the plant, and the pea-green leaves are entirely overshadowed by them. The plant belongs to the Gentian Family.

Pink centaurium has a very narrow range, being confined to moderate altitudes in southern California.

We gathered specimens at Torrey Pines, near La Jolla, California.

"NODDING ONION

Allium cernuum Roth

In the Canadian Rockies, nodding onion is a conspicuous plant, growing plentifully on the drier slopes. Its graceful leaves and stems, the latter curved downward near the top, differentiate it from other members of the Lily Family. If its identification is in doubt, however, the smell and taste of garlic, when the stems are broken, enable one to place it at once.

This onion has a remarkably wide range, occurring from Virginia and New York to New Mexico and British Columbia.

We gathered it in the Ice River Valley, twenty miles by trail south of Leanchoil Station on the Canadian Pacific Railway, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"ROCKY MOUNTAIN RHODODENDRON

Rhododendron albiflorum Hooker

To those familiar with the eastern rhododendrons, with their glossy evergreen leaves, the Rocky Mountain rhododendron is a surprise, for it has deciduous leaves, and the flowers are not in clusters at the ends of the branches, but are scattered along the leafy twigs. The creamy flowers, often tinged with pink, remind us of orange blossoms. Bees are much attracted to them. No one who has traveled over the trails in the Canadian Rockies could have overlooked this beautiful plant. It usually grows in acid soil in company with menziesia and blueberry bushes, on steep, partially shaded slopes.

Rocky Mountain rhododendron has a narrow range, from Montana to Washington, British Columbia, and Alberta.

It is very plentiful at Glacier, British Columbia, where this specimen was gathered at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"FOREST ANEMONE

Anemone deltoidea Hooker

This beautiful anemone grows plentifully in deep woods, sheltered from the hot rays of the sun. Its blooming season is much longer than that of most other western anemones, which prefer alpine meadows in full sunshine. The single flower grows at the end of the slender stem, and the pale yellow stamens and pure white petal-like sepals are very conspicuous by contrast with the shade and dark coloring of the forest floor. The species has creeping roots, and often grows in clumps. It belongs to the Buttercup Family.

Forest anemone has a narrow range, being found only in northern California, Washington, and Oregon.

We found our specimens in Mount Rainier National Park.

"WESTERN CRANESBILL

Geranium viscosissimum Fisher and Meyer

Western cranesbill is a more robust plant than its relative, the wild geranium, which is so common in the Eastern woods in spring. The flowers are borne on sturdy stems well above the beautiful cluster of rich green leaves, making the plant almost a bouquet in itself. The name cranesbill comes from the resemblance of the seed pod to the bill of a crane.

Western cranesbill belongs to the Geranium Family. It is found from Colorado and California northward to South Dakota, Alberta, and British Columbia.

We gathered the flowers in a beautiful meadow, a day and a half by trail northeast of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"GREEN STRAWBERRY-CACTUS

Echinocereus vividiflorus Engelman

One of the commonest members of the cactus family in the western United States is the green strawberry-cactus, which grows abundantly in many places in the Rocky Mountain region, usually about rocks on the foothills, or along the stony banks of stream beds. Because of its neat habit, and beautifully colored spines, the plant is one of the most attractive of our cactuses, and is frequently used as a pot plant. The spines, although sharp, are placed in such a manner that they are not very offensive when the plant is handled, in spite of the fact that they protect it effectively from animals which might eat the succulent stem. The flowers are small, and inconspicuously colored. The small green juicy fruits are edible when ripe.

The green strawberry-cactus ranges from western Texas and the desert of northern Mexico as far northward as southern Wyoming.

The specimen sketched came from Texas.

"PRAIRIE THISTLE

Cirsium undulatum (Nuttall) Sprengel

We lately saw the prairie thistle in perfection. Our horses grazed on the mountain side back of our camp, and every plant to which they had access was denuded of its flowers as soon as they opened. Fortunately, a wire fence protected the garden at Radium Hot Springs, and under this protection we found a good specimen.

The plant is a picturesque one. The large purple flowers are very sweet and attract many insects to their feast of nectar. The leaves are very prickly and much waved, so that it is sometimes called wavy-leaved thistle. We marveled that the apparently tender lining of the horses' mouths was not injured by the stiff prickles.

Prairie thistle ranges from Michigan to Arizona and British Columbia.

The sketch was made from a plant that grew near Radium Hot Springs in the Columbia River Valley, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"LILAC MARIPOSA

Calochortus splendens Douglas

It is a difficult matter to restrain one’s enthusiasm while riding over the foothills in California when the mariposas are in bloom. Their great variety is marvelous, and as their stems are so slender, they truly appear like a host of butterflies as they sway in the wind. One of the loveliest of them all is the lilac mariposa. It was a beautiful day when we found them at the Santa Ana Ranch near Santa Ana, California, and each specimen seemed more beautiful than the last.

The mariposas are members of the Lily Family, related to the garden tulips, which are derived from Old World species belonging to a different genus. The mariposas are of purely West American range, no variety being found east of Nebraska. Some of the mariposas have edible bulbs, which are highly valued by the Indians.

"ORANGE-EYE GLOBEMALLOW

Sphaeralcea davidsonii Robinson

The striking combination of color in the flowers of the orange-eye globemallow is their greatest charm. The center is a brilliant vermilion, and the cupped petals surrounding it are a beautiful soft pink. The grouping of the stamens in a sort of column is a feature which characterizes most members of the Mallow Family.

Orange-eye globemallow is found only in southern California.

The plant sketched grew at the Santa Ana Ranch, near Santa Ana, California.

"TASSEL COTTONGRASS

Eriophorum angustifolium Roth

We had passed many seasons on the trail without meeting specimens of the tassel cottongrass. This was not because it is rare, but because its heads are spoiled completely by wind, snow, or rain, and it is then easily passed unnoticed. But when in perfection, the plant is most attractive. The heads are supported on tall stems, with the dainty tassels pendent on slender threads from the cluster above them. We finally discovered it in great quantities in a grassy swamp.

Tassel cottongrass has a wide range, in regions of cold climate, occurring from Maine to Newfoundland, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, and Alaska. It also occurs in Europe and Asia.

The sketch was made from specimens found at Pipestone Pass, three days by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

"WESTERN MONKEYFLOWER

Mimulus guttatus Don

The moist earth in the vicinity of springs and along the banks of the little streams that flow from them, is favorable for the lush growth of the western monkeyflower. Its clear yellow flowers are set off to perfection by the brilliant green leaves. The plant is easily crushed, and therefore difficult to carry away from its chosen situation, but with care it will last if kept in water in a cool place.

We found this specimen near Vancouver, but it also occurs from northern Mexico and New Mexico to California, Alaska, and Saskatchewan. It belongs to the Figwort Family.

"GOLDENBOWL MARIPOSA

Calochortus clavatus Watson

Growing on a tall stem, its bowl of clear yellow waving in the breeze, what could be more graceful and beautiful than the flower of the goldenbowl mariposa? We are amazed at the variety of color, with endless gradations, in the members of this genus, variations that are increased in number by hybridization. This species exhibits even more strikingly than those previously described the relation of the genus to the tulips of Europe.

Goldenbowl mariposa is found only in central and southern California.

"RED MONKEYFLOWER

Diplacus puniceus Nuttall

Red monkeyflower is a bushy plant four to five feet tall, with bright green foliage, beautifully decorated with velvety red flowers. It is most attractive when found growing in the crevices of the sea cliffs on the coast, or the steep sides of the arroyos. Perhaps the florets of some species of this genus, a typical member of the Figwort Family, may resemble monkey faces as implied in the common name but as far as this flower is concerned, the resemblance is remote.

Red monkeyflower is found only in California, and is especially abundant in the region about Torrey Pines, where the sketch was made.

"COLUMBIA LILY

Lilium columbianum Hanson

The western lilies are always a joy to behold. Many of them rise on tall stems above the surrounding vegetation, which forms a perfect background for their graceful beauty. The Columbia lily shown in the illustration was obtained in Indian Henry's Garden in Mount Rainier National Park, at an altitude of 2,000 feet, where the plants are more delicate than those found at lower elevations.

Columbia lily ranges from California to Idaho and British Columbia.

"CRANBERRYBUSH

Viburnum pauciflorum Pylaic

Cranberrybush is a straggling erect shrub growing in cold mountain woods and along the banks of streams. The few red berries are very attractive, but are sour to the taste, not unlike ordinary cranberries. The cranberrybush belongs to the Honeysuckle Family, while the true cranberry, a small slender trailing plant, belongs to the Heath Family.

The cranberrybush ranges from Pennsylvania to Newfoundland and from Colorado to Alaska.

The specimen sketched was obtained in the Columbia River Valley, in British Columbia, at an altitude of 2,500 feet.

"RUFF GENTIAN

Gentiana calycosa Grisebach

The flowers of this lovely gentian are of a wonderful deep blue color. As soon as the direct rays of the sun strike them, the petals open, and the clumps are covered with brilliant flowers. On a cloudy day, when they are closed, it is easy to pass without noticing them, even where they are abundant. The plants are usually found about tree line, or in grassy alpine meadows at a slightly lower altitude. The large calyx suggests a sixteenth century ruff.

Ruff gentian ranges from Montana and Wyoming to Washington and California.

We found quantities of this gentian at Indian Pass in Glacier National Park, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

"MENZIES PENTSTEMON

Pentstemon menziesii Hooker

While we were driving along the motor road in Rainier National Park near Paradise Valley, our attention was attracted by a conspicuous outcrop of gray rock. Near the top of this broken rock-pile appeared clumps of pink flowers, which proved to be the pentstemon named in honor of the Scotch explorer Menzies. The lovely flowers appear to best advantage when growing in crevices with the gray rocks behind them.

The pentstemons belong to the Figwort Family. This species is found only in Washington and British Columbia.

"PURPLE PRAIRIECLOVER

Petalostemon purpureum (Ventenat) Rydberg

Purple prairieclover, as its name implies, grows abundantly in the prairie country. It is an attractive plant, and its blossoms have the advantage of lasting longer, when gathered and placed in water, than most of our wild flowers.

Purple prairieclover belongs to the Pea Family. It has a rather wide range, being found from Indiana to Colorado and Texas, and northward to Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

The sketch was made from specimens found on the prairie east of Glacier National Park in Montana.

"FLOWERING DOGWOOD

Cornus florida Linnaeus

Dogwood grows abundantly in the favored regions which it inhabits. When the tree is in bloom in early spring, the profuse blossoms appear like a cloud of great snowflakes falling through the interlaced branches. The large flower buds are well developed before the leaves fall in autumn. When warmer days have come the four small bracts, which protect the buds, expand into the white petal-like organs which surround the yellow-green florets clustered in the center. The dogwood tree grows to a maximum height of twenty feet with a trunk sometimes eighteen inches in diameter. Its bark is gray and cracked into squares, and the wood is close-grained and heavy. Its firm and even texture, and its quality of drying without cracking, makes it a favorite wood for wedges in lumber camps and for spindles and bobbins in cotton mills. Dogwood is the State flower of Virginia, and no more beautiful and suitable plant could have been chosen. Occasionally the bracts are pink. Both color types are extensively cultivated, thriving best in a moderately acid soil.

Flowering dogwood is found from Florida and Texas northward to southern Maine, Ontario, and Minnesota, and related species occur in the Pacific Coast States, and in Japan, Korea, and China.

The sketch was made in Washington, District of Columbia.

"FLOWERING DOGWOOD

Cornus florida Linnaeus

As autumn approaches, the leaves of the dogwood assume gorgeous tints of crimson and yellow, and at the same season the clusters of brilliant red berries reach their maturity. Robins and many other birds are especially fond of the juicy though bitter berries, and frequently they eat them all before winter comes. The seeds are stored by small mammals for winter use. Sometimes the fruits remain on the tree until far into the winter. In late autumn, in some places, they are so abundant as to give a red color to the woods.

Dogwood is found from Florida to Texas, and northward to southern Maine, Ontario, and Minnesota.

The branch illustrated grew near Fairfax, Virginia, a region where the berries are exceptionally large and well developed.

"WITCH-HAZEL

Hamamelis virginiana Linnaeus

In late autumn, when the leaves have nearly all fallen, and all other flowers long since have faded, the witch-hazel comes into bloom.

For now the gray witch-hazel gives her flowers,
Her tiny blooms, that sweeten all the air,
To greet November’s sun and chilly showers,
With something dainty, hardy, sweet and fair.
Elusive, drifting, cool and vaguely sweet,
It gives the day a meaning all its own,
November’s incense, as she comes to meet
The winter, when all flower scents have flown.

L. CLaupE.

The dainty pale yellow flowers sprawl from the axils of the yellow tinted leaves, and sometimes open even after the last leaf has fallen. The fruits do not ripen until almost a year has passed. Then the hard dry seeds are shot from the slowly splitting capsules to a distance of many yards from the parent plant. Witch-hazel was named by the early colonists from a fancied resemblance to another plant known to them in western Europe, and much of the folk-lore connected with the latter was transferred with the name. The twigs are supposed to possess occult powers when in the hands of persons capable of interpreting the movements, and to reveal the presence of water or mineral deposits. Witch-hazel is used in medicine, because of the soothing properties of the distilled extract.

The witch-hazels belong to a small plant family distantly related to the roses. The species here described is found from Florida northward to Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Minnesota. A relative that grows from Louisiana to Missouri blooms in earliest spring.

The specimens painted grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"MAY POP

Passiflora incarnata Linnaeus

The Passionflower Family of three hundred and fifty species is exclusively American, and nearly all the species are inhabitants of the tropics. Only a few are found in the United States, and of these, the maypop is hardy as far north as Virginia and even farther northward. It is a vigorous vine, often growing thirty feet in length, with many tendrils and rich green leaves. The peculiarly scented flowers attract universal attention by their complicated structure and coloring. The various organs of the flower suggested to the devout Spaniards the objects associated with the passion of our Lord, and the Latin name was given in consequence. The fruit is as large as a hen’s egg and pale yellow. Its smooth rind is very tough, and the many and large seeds are surrounded by a juicy sweet pulp, which is eaten by children. Some of the tropical passionflowers are highly esteemed for their edible fruits of superior flavor. The common name of the plant refers to the loud popping noise that it makes when squeezed until it bursts. Tennessee has adopted it as the State flower.

The maypop grows from Florida to Texas and northward to Virginia, southern Indiana, and Missouri. It is easily cultivated, but is not safe to introduce into small gardens, because of its spreading tendencies.

The sketch was made from specimens secured near Savannah, Georgia.

"SWEETBAY

Magnolia virginiana Linnaeus

Sweetbay is found in swampy woods or deep swamps where it is usually a shrub, although sometimes attaining the size of a tree. The leathery leaves are silvery beneath, and their upper surface is a rich dark green. The solitary flowers are borne at the tips of the branches, where the creamy petals contrast pleasingly with the deeply colored foliage. Their delicious and pervasive odor is their greatest attraction. Long after the flowers have passed, they are succeeded by a cone-shaped fruit in which, when fully ripe, the separate parts split open, and the seeds with their bright red fleshy covering dangle by slender threads. When the thread finally breaks, the seeds are blown by the wind to substantial distances. While beavers were abundant they felled the trunks of these trees for building their dams, and they were so fond of the bark that it was employed frequently to bait beaver traps. Sweetbay is often called beaver tree.

This striking member of the Magnolia Family is found around the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to Texas and Arkansas, and northward along the Atlantic coastal plain to Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. It always grows in the most acid of soils, and thrives in cultivation only if planted in such soils.

It grows plentifully in the neighborhood of Washington, District of Columbia, where this specimen was found.

"LAMBKILL

Kalmia angustifolia Linnaeus

Lambkill, although closely related to mountain laurel, is conspicuously different in its low stature and smaller but more brightly colored flowers. It is a beautiful member of the Heath Family. The shrub grows from six inches to three feet in height, and where it is plentiful, colors the hillsides or swamps with its rich crimson. The plant, as its popular name intimates, is very poisonous to stock, which sometimes eat the young leaves. Its poisonous properties were well known to the Indians who inhabited the Eastern States.

This species has a wide range. It is found from Georgia to Michigan and northward to Newfoundland and Hudson Bay.

The sketch was made from specimens collected near Washington, District of Columbia.

"PINK LADYSLIPPER

Cypripedium acaule Aiton

Pink ladyslipper, often called moccasin-flower, is always a delight to the flower lover, for it seems like some exotic visitor. In fact, it is not surpassed in beauty by many of the choicest orchids of the tropics. It adapts itself readily to cultivation in a wild garden if suitable acid soil is provided, for it is one of the most acid-loving of all our native plants. It reappears year after year when once established. The term acaule, meaning “stemless,” applies to the leaves and not to the flower, for the latter grows at the top of a slender stem — springing up between two broad green leaves which often lie close against the soil. It is the largest flower produced by any of our native northern orchids. Bumblebees are attracted to the nectar and enter the pouch, at the top of which it is secreted. Frequently, however, they find escape difficult, sometimes even biting their way out to freedom. Those which manage to emerge through the openings beside the anthers rub off some of the sticky pollen, and without knowing it, carry this to another flower and leave it on the stigma there, thus bringing about cross-pollination and the production of fertile seed.

Pink ladyslipper is found from the mountains of Alabama northward to Newfoundland and westward to Manitoba.

The flowers sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"PAPAW

Asimina triloba (Linnaeus) Dunal

The papaw is a tall shrub or small tree from ten to forty-five feet in height. It grows in rich ground along river bottoms, where owing to the soft and unobtrusive coloring of the flowers, it is easily overlooked when in bloom. The flowers appear earlier than the leaves, along with those of dogwood and redbud, but the fruits do not ripen until October. They grow singly or in sparse bunches, and are of the size and shape of short stout bananas. When ripe, they are colored deep yellow. Opinions differ as to their palatability, but many persons enjoy their sweet aromatic flavor. The old French settlers called them “assimin,” a name derived from that used in a dialect of the Algonquian Indians, and the genus name is derived from this term. The papaw belongs to the tropical Anona Family, but the eight species of Asimina are all native in the southern United States.

This specimen grew on Plummers Island, Maryland, near Washington, District of Columbia.

Papaw ranges from Florida westward to Texas and Kansas and northward to New York, southern Ontario, and Michigan.

"DRUMMOND PITCHERPLANT

Sarracenia drummondii Croom

The thrill of finding a pitcher plant in bloom is a rare experience, for the petals of these plants are short-lived. The umbel left behind is a curious object, but it lacks the distinctive beauty of the perfect flower, with its brilliant petals. Many insects are attracted to the treacherous pitchers and are lured to their death. Of all our wild flowers, pitcher plants are the most fascinating from the standpoint of their relations to insects, excepting only the orchids. They yield readily to cultivation in a cool greenhouse, when given the proper acid soil and abundant moisture about their roots, approximating natural conditions. This may be accomplished by the use of a double pot, with peat moss in the interspace.

Drummond Pitcherplant is one of the largest of the several species of the genus, its pitchers reaching a height of three or even four feet. It is native in a rather restricted area along the Gulf Coast, from southwestern Georgia and western Florida to southern Mississippi.

The plant painted was brought into bloom in the greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture in Washington.

"YELLOW CUCUMBERTREE

Magnolia cordata Michaux

Yellow cucumbertree is one of the rare members of the Magnolia Family, its range being confined to the State of Georgia. This species has had a peculiar history, having been discovered by Michaux in the course of his famous exploration trips in this country in the latter part of the eighteenth century, then being lost to science for a long period, and rediscovered in the wild in recent years.

A fine specimen on the grounds of the Department of Agriculture in Washington always draws much attention, especially when adorned with its showy blossoms. The flowers resemble somewhat those of the tuliptree, which indeed is a close relative, but the cucumbertree flowers earlier in the season.

The specimen sketched was given me by the Honorable Henry C. Wallace, at that time Secretary of Agriculture.

"JACK-IN-THE-PULPIT

Arisaema triphyllum (Linnaeus) Torrey

Jack-in-the-pulpit, sometimes called Indian turnip, comes into bloom in spring along with violets and columbines. It thrives in rich moist woods, and in favorable surroundings develops into a plant two feet tall. Some spathes contain staminate flowers and others pistillate flowers. In some cases both staminate and pistillate flowers are found in the same plant, the latter growing above the former at the base of the club. The fruit, which consists of a ball of bright red berries, ripens in September. The bulblike corm, sunk deep in the ground, is very pungent when tasted raw, causing the mouth and tongue to burn for hours afterward. It was used by the Indians as food, however, after baking or boiling to remove the irritating substances.

The Arum family, to which Jack-in-the-pulpit belongs, is composed chiefly of tropical plants but includes the skunk cabbage, wild calla, green dragon, and golden club, as well as the cultivated calla.

Jack-in-the-pulpit is found from Florida to Kansas and northward to Nova Scotia and Minnesota. Our specimen grew at Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.

Jack-in-the-pulpit preaches today,
Under the green trees, just over the way;
Squirrel and song sparrow high on their perch,
Hear the sweet lily-bells ringing to church.
Come hear what his reverence rises to say,
In his low painted pulpit, this calm Sabbath day.
Fair is the canopy over him seen
Penciled by nature’s hand, black, brown and green.
Green is his surplice, green are his bands;
In his queer little pulpit, the little priest stands.

"BLUEFLAG IRIS

Iris versicolor Linnaeus

Blueflag iris loves swamps and wet meadows because it requires ample moisture in order to flourish. Its blue flowers attract bees and other insects; these are necessary to the formation of viable seeds, for the shape and arrangement of the petals are such as to make self-pollination impossible. The thick root is considered poisonous, and although this is not fully substantiated, the foliage evidently contains a repellent, for cattle never eat it. The irises derive their name from the Greek word meaning rainbow.

Blueflag iris has a wide range, growing from the mountains of North Carolina northward to Newfoundland. Closely related species also occur in adjoining territory.

The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"VIRGINIA STEWARTIA

Stewartia malachodendron Linnaeus

The few species of stewartia found in the southeastern United States and eastern Asia are all rare and local plants, familiar to few botanists. Their beauty deserves for them a wider acquaintance. This stewartia is a shrub growing from six to twelve feet high, and is usually found in low woods. The unusual coloring of the stamens, especially the anthers, gives the flowers a very remarkable appearance, and the leaves in autumn are colored brilliantly with red and orange. The genus name was given in honor of John Stuart, Earl of Bute, a patron of botany, but Linnaeus adopted the name in the form Stewartia. It belongs to the Tea Family.

Stewartia ranges from Florida to Virginia and west to Louisiana.

The sketch was made from a specimen gathered on Ladys Island near Beaufort, South Carolina.

"WAX TRILLIUM

Trillium album (Michaux) Small

Wax trillium is one of the trilliums which is little known and seldom seen, but for that very reason, it is of greater interest when found. Moist woods and thickets are its favorite habitat. Since it thrives in cultivation in a wild garden, as do most of its relatives, it may be enjoyed each succeeding spring. It may be a color form of the well-known purple trillium (Trillium erectum). It occurs as isolated plants throughout the range of that species, from the mountains of Georgia and Alabama to Nova Scotia and Manitoba. The trilliums belong to the Lily Family, and the numerous species occurring in North America are distributed from coast to coast.

The specimen sketched was obtained from a wild garden near Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.

"LOBLOLLY PINE

Pinus taeda Linnaeus

We are so apt to consider the various kinds of pine trees as similar and uninteresting, that when a loblolly pine is investigated in its blooming season in earliest spring, its curious flowers shedding their clouds of dustlike pollen are an unexpected novelty. Produced plentifully at the tips of the twigs, they are so abundant as to give a brownish tinge to the whole tree. The embryonic cones are inconspicuous at this season, reaching their full size only at the end of autumn, but they enlarge after pollination has occurred. Loblolly pine is a large forest tree occasionally reaching a height of one hundred and fifty feet, with a trunk five feet in diameter. It springs up in clearings or in old fields and is often called oldfield pine. The long leaves are usually in threes. The wood is coarse-grained and brittle.

Loblolly pine ranges from Florida north to Delaware and New Jersey and west to Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.

The sketch was made at Beaufort, South Carolina.

PLATE 335",LOBLOLLY PINE,Pinus taeda Linnaeus,"Loblolly pine ranges from Florida north to Delaware and New Jersey and west to Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.","The sketch was made at Beaufort, South Carolina.",335,335,42669384,South Carolina,USA
"FRINGED GENTIAN

Gentiana crinita Froelich

Fringed gentian is a plant always surrounded with sentiment, which is reflected in Bryant's lines:

Thou waitest late, and comest alone
When woods are bare and birds have flown,
And frosts and shortening days portend
The aged seat is: meet his end.

Then doth thy sweet and quiet eye
Look through its fringes to the sky,
A flower from its cerulean wall.

In some years the fringed gentian may be found growing plentifully in a given locality, but the next season it may be sought in vain in the same spot. The fact that the plant is a biennial, flowering only in its second season, sometimes accounts for this, although in some places other individuals come into bloom in the in-between years. The seeds, although numerous, are very small and light and easily washed away by rain or blown about by the wind. There are seven hundred members of the Gentian Family, most of them found in temperate and arctic regions, although many others grow in the higher mountains of tropical countries. The name is derived from that of King Gentius of Illyria.

Fringed gentian has a wide range, from the mountains of Georgia to Quebec and South Dakota.

The flowers sketched were obtained near Mount Kisco, New York.

"WHITE EPIDENDRUM

Epidendrum nocturnum Jaquin

In the deep cypress swamps of southern Florida the white epidendrum, known locally as bark orchid, is of frequent occurrence, although sometimes it is perched so high upon the tree that it is difficult to discover. The very minute seeds, carried by the breeze to some branch, germinate and develop slowly, if the conditions are exactly right, into tiny plants which take several years to reach maturity. The plants cling tightly by their thick, fleshy roots to the branches. The white flowers of this epidendrum, although not so showy as those of some of its tropical relatives, are very beautiful, and like the blossoms of most orchids, they last for a long time after they have opened. Their fragrance, which is especially noticeable at night, is attractive to moths, which feed on the nectar and unwittingly accomplish cross-pollination in carrying the pollen from flower to flower.

The dense hammocks of the lower Florida wilds bordering Coot Bay and the ramifying channels leading to and from it in Monroe County contain probably the finest development of epiphytic plants in the United States. Here many species of orchids, bromeliads, and ferns, in endless number, drape and festoon the branches to form a veritable hanging garden.

This specimen came from Coot Bay, Florida. The plant is rather generally distributed in the West Indies and elsewhere in tropical America.

"BLUEBEAD

Clintonia borealis (Aiton) Rafinesque

Bluebead is found in cool, mossy, shady woods, where its handsome large green leaves draw attention to the greenish-yellow bell-shaped flowers which are borne on a sturdy stem well above them. The large dark blue fleshy fruits, to which the common name refers, are more conspicuous than the flowers. They are held upright on their stiff stems, and are familiar to every nature lover who visits the northern woods in late summer. The Clintonia were named for DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, who was an enthusiastic botanist. They belong to the Lily Family.

This species has a wide range, occurring from the high mountains of North Carolina westward to Wisconsin and northward to Newfoundland and Minnesota.

The plant sketched was obtained near Canandaigua, New York.

"YELLOW TROUTLILY

Erythronium americanum Kell.

Yellow troutlily is one of our early spring flowers, making its appearance at the same time as bloodroot and toothwort. The lush leaves are as fresh and lovely as the blossoms. These almost close at night, and open only sluggishly in daylight, failing to revive when picked. The shady meadows bordering streams are their favored habitat, and here mats of the leaves, sometimes acres in extent, often closely carpet the ground. Only a few individuals bear flowers, however, for like many other wild flowers several years are necessary for its bulbs to mature. The troutlilies belong to the Lily Family, and the approved common name, which was coined by the famous naturalist, John Burroughs, emphasizes this fact. The name used in some books, dogtooth violet, is highly inappropriate, for the flower does not bear the slightest resemblance to a violet.

Yellow troutlily has a wide range, from Florida to Arkansas, and north to Minnesota, Ontario, and Nova Scotia.

The specimens sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.

"YELLOW FRINGE ORCHID

Habenaria ciliaris (Linnaeus) Robert Brown

Yellow fringe orchid is one of our showy representatives of the Orchid Family, and its only rival in brilliance of coloration in its accustomed habitat is the cardinal flower. The accepted common name is somewhat inappropriate, however, for its color is really of a decidedly orange hue. Growing two or three feet in height, in a ferny meadow or wet bog, or on the banks of a quiet stream, its bright orange color beckons the long-tongued butterflies and moths to visit it. In twilight it is easily seen by the large moths which hover over it; these are often mistaken for hummingbirds through the similarity in their manner of flight. It is a sturdy and elegant plant, and to find it growing in perfect development is a joy never to be forgotten.

Yellow fringe orchid has a wide range, from Florida to Texas and northward to Vermont, Ontario, and Michigan. It can be cultivated only in highly acid soil.

The sketch was made from plants gathered near Bridgeport, Connecticut.

"WHITEFLOWERING RASPBERRY

Rubus parviflorus Nuttall

The slightly crinkled petals of the whiteflowering raspberry are conspicuous against their background of rich green maple-shaped leaves. It is fully as attractive as its eastern relative, the flowering raspberry, which bears purple flowers. The whiteflowering raspberry grows from two to six feet tall, the lower part of the stems being brown and woody. It frequents rich woods often at high altitudes in the mountains. The berries are disappointing to the taste, and full of small seeds. The plant belongs to the Rose Family, its range extending from extreme northern Mexico to California and Alaska, and eastward to Michigan and westernmost Ontario.

In the vicinity of Glacier, British Columbia, where the sketch was made, and all through the Selkirk Mountains, it is especially abundant. This specimen was obtained at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"SALTMARSH ROSEGENTIAN

Sabbatia stellaris Pursh

The delicate star-shaped flowers of marsh rosegentian are distributed plentifully in salt marshes along the Atlantic coast, and arcs of the flowers may be seen in favored places in midsummer. The color varies from white to deep pink. The contrast between the color of the petals and the carmine-bordered yellow eye is most pleasing. Many other Sabbatias grow in the eastern half of the United States, especially southward. Some of them have even larger and brighter flowers than the saltmarsh rosegentian. The Sabbatias belong to the Gentian Family.

Because of its preference for salt, this plant does not extend inland, but it spreads along the coast from Florida to Louisiana and Maine. The flowers sketched were found near Bridgeport, Connecticut.

"FRINGED PARNASSIA

Parnassia fimbriata Konig

Fringed parnassia is a hardy and beautiful plant, closely related to the Saxifrage Family. The dainty flower stalks spring from a cluster of smooth green leaves, each stem supporting a single creamy white flower about an inch across, and the delicate fringes along the sides of the petals are a feature seldom found in flowers. The plants grow plentifully along rivulets, and on moist banks irrigated by snow-water. The size of the plant varies greatly with altitude. In low-lying valleys the flower stems may be two feet tall, but on higher mountain slopes only an inch or two in length.

Fringed parnassia is distributed from California and New Mexico northward to Alberta and Alaska.

The plant sketched grew near Lake O'Hara, ten miles from Hector, British Columbia, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"BOURGEAU ROSE

Rosa bourgeauiana Crepin

If you happen to journey in June to the upper Columbia River Valley, British Columbia, you will be rewarded by seeing the wild roses in full bloom. In no other part of the country where we traveled, except near Banff, do they show such marvelous color and size, or grow so plentifully. Their delicious odor is everywhere. The sturdy bushes frequently grow to a height of four feet or more. Their woody brown stems are well protected by many slender down-curved spines. Four States have chosen the rose as their official flower—Iowa, North Dakota, New York, and Georgia, but the particular rose so honored is not always designated. Georgia has chosen the Cherokee rose, introduced long ago from China.

The Bourgeau rose is found from Colorado and Montana northward to British Columbia and Mackenzie, and rarely eastward to Ontario.

The plant sketched was obtained near Lake Minnewonka, ten miles from Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.

"BOURGEAU ROSE

Rosa bourgeauiana Crepin

The beautiful flowers of the Bourgeau rose are followed by the conspicuous red fruits or hips. They have a pleasant flavor, but are irritating to the human throat. They are a favorite food of many birds and small mammals. Formerly, before so many delicious fruits were obtainable, these hips were used to fill tarts, and in northern Europe a kind of fruit soup was made from them. In the United States they were used in jelly by those seeking novelties of this sort.

The Bourgeau rose is found from Colorado and Montana, northward to British Columbia, Alberta, and Mackenzie, and eastward to Ontario.

Near Sinclair Canyon, Alberta, where this specimen was gathered, they grew in large quantities at an altitude of 3,000 feet.

"PURPLE PENTSTEMON

Pentstemon lyalli Gray

Purple pentstemon is one of the finest of all the pentstemons, especially when it finds a congenial situation. In disintegrated limestone it thrives luxuriantly, often forming low dense clumps two or three feet in diameter and completely covered with large purple blossoms which resemble those of foxglove, one of its relatives. The flowers, borne at the ends of the stems, are so heavy that they weigh the branches to the ground. On slopes above timberline where it is subjected to severe climatic conditions it is very beautiful in contrast with gray rocks, especially when growing in rock crevices.

Purple pentstemon belongs to the Figwort Family and ranges from Idaho and Montana northward to Alberta and British Columbia.

We gathered them in perfection in Sinclair Canyon, near Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.

"CANADA VIOLET

Viola canadensis Linnaeus

Canada violet is easily recognized, because its habit of growth is different from that of most members of the Violet Family. The plants grow to a height of six inches to even two feet in favored situations, and the pale, rather inconspicuous, slightly scented flowers spring from the axils of the leaves. The Canada violet prefers moist shady places in the proximity of pines and firs, but it grows also in alpine meadows. Its flowering season is longer than that of most violets, lasting well into the summer.

The wide range of Canada violet makes it a familiar plant to many flower lovers. It occurs from the mountains of Alabama and Arizona northward to Newfoundland and Alaska.

The sketch was made at Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, where the plant was found at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"WOOLLY ARNICA

Arnica tomentosa Macoun

Woolly arnica is one of many species of this genus, which belongs to the Aster Family. It is a graceful perennial with large bright yellow flower heads produced at the ends of the stems. Like other parts of the plant, the leaves are conspicuously woolly, hence the appropriateness of the name given to it. We found this arnica growing high on the mountainside where it maintained a precarious foothold in shallow soil in crevices of limestone rocks.

This species has a narrow range, occurring only in Alberta and British Columbia.

The plant illustrated was gathered in the valley of the Siffleur River, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"STRAWBERRY-BLITE

Chenopodium capitatum (Linnaeus) Ascherson

The flowers of strawberry-blite are small, greenish, and inconspicuous. The plant is showy, however, in late summer when in fruit. It produces quantities of globular, pulpy, berrylike fruits crowded on the stems, which appear too weak to carry such a heavy load. It is sometimes called Indian strawberry, although it is not at all related to the true strawberries, being a member of the Goosefoot Family. The fruit is not eaten, but the Indians used the red juice of the fruit as a dye.

This plant has a wide range, occurring from New Jersey northward to Nova Scotia and westward to Illinois, California, and Alaska. It is found also in Europe and Asia.

The specimens painted were gathered by the side of the motor road in the Bow Valley between Banff and Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.

"WESTERN RATTLESNAKEPLANTAIN

Peramium decipiens (Hooker) Piper

The common name applied to this plant refers to the resemblance of the beautiful white veinings of the leaves to the markings on a rattlesnake. It seems a pity to be obliged to include the word “plantain” in its name, however, for it is not in any way related to the weeds to which this name applies, being instead a delicate orchid. The technical name of the genus is not used in all books, some authors preferring to substitute Epipactis or Goodyera. The rosette of leaves is more conspicuous than the flowers, which are borne, usually, on one side of a stout stem. The plant loves decaying wood, and it grows frequently under evergreen trees where the air is cool and damp, though the soil is dry.

Western rattlesnakeplantain occurs from the mountains of New Mexico and California northward to British Columbia and sparingly eastward to the Great Lakes region, and even to northern Maine and Quebec.

We found it in the Selkirk Mountains twenty miles beyond Glacier, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.

"BUR-FORGET-ME-NOT

Lappula diffusa (Lehmann) Greene

Bur-forget-me-not is a lovely plant growing two feet in height and bearing a profusion of delicately scented blue flowers. When it was in fruit we were disillusioned as to its character, for we found that each flower produced a small round bur covered with prickles which attached itself to any passing object and was difficult to loosen. The plant is especially plentiful in the tracks of old snow slides, for it delights in the cool moisture of slopes where much snow has melted. Sometimes the flowers are white.

Bur-forget-me-not ranges from Colorado to California and northward to Alberta and British Columbia.

We found the plant growing near Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"ALPINE FORGET-ME-NOT

Myosotis alpestris Schmidt

Alpine forget-me-not has lovely blue, slightly scented flowers, densely clustered, with deep yellow centers. It prefers moist alpine slopes near timberline, and here it is found in perfection, coming into flower throughout the summer as the snow recedes. Like many alpine plants, it has shorter stems when it grows at higher elevations - on the mountain sides, and there it may properly be described as a cluster of blue flowers surrounded by a rosette of green hairy leaves.

The forget-me-nots belong to the Borage Family. This one has a comparatively narrow range in North America, occurring from Colorado to Alberta and Alaska. It is found also in Europe and Asia.

In the region near Baker Lake, ten miles from Lake Louise, Alberta, where these flowers were gathered, it grows in perfection at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

"WHITE GLOBEFLOWER

Trollius albiflorus (Gray) Rydberg

Alpine meadows, the wet margins of streams, and the edges of melting snow patches are the places most frequented by the white globeflower. It blooms so early in the season that it is usually in fruit before the eastern visitor arrives, though often retarded plants may be found in blossom even at the end of the summer, pushing through a thin sheet of ice at the border of an obstinate snowbank. The globeflower belongs to the Buttercup Family, and looks much like some of its cousins of that group, the anemones.

The range of this species is from Colorado to Washington, Alberta, and British Columbia.

We gathered it in the meadows near Mount Assiniboine, fifty miles south of Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

"PERENNIAL GAILLARDIA

gailardia aristata Pursh

Perennial gaillardia is one of the gaudiest of the mountain flowers, and in its abundance and display of color recalls the familiar black-eyed-susan of eastern pastures. We often found the flower heads so large and beautiful that the plant seems to have no need of improvement by the hand of man, although this gaillardia was brought into cultivation long ago, and is now a well-known garden plant all over the world. It prefers dry slopes and many fine flower heads are often borne on a single plant. It belongs to the great Aster Family. This and other species of gaillardia are often seen in gardens.

Perennial gaillardia ranges from Colorado and South Dakota to Oregon and British Columbia.

This specimen grew near Emerald Lake, seven miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"PTARMIGAN BERRY

Arctous alpina (Linnaeus) Niedenzu

This dwarf shrub of the Heath Family is a colorful plant in autumn when its leaves turn crimson and it is decorated with red berries. Growing flat on the ground, it makes brilliant patches of color under the willows, alders, and scrub pines which form open thickets over the shaly flats deposited by glacial streams. By some authorities the red-berried form here pictured is separated as a variety from the more widespread black-berried one. Under the name Arctous erythrocarpa or Arctous alpina rubra, the ptarmigan berry grows at high altitudes in widely separated districts of Maine, New Hampshire, and Greenland, and from British Columbia to Alaska. It occurs also in Europe and Asia.

The plant was especially beautiful in Douglas Canyon Valley, which leads from Red Deer River Valley, fifty miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, where we found it at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"HOODED LADIES-TRESSES

Ibidium strictum (Rydberg) House

Hooded ladies-tresses is later in blooming than most of our native orchids, and often delays flowering until the end of summer. It grows in moist or swampy places, in low meadows or near the borders of streams. It is a very sweet-scented plant and is often abundant where congenial soil and moisture conditions exist. Cross-pollination of the flowers is ensured by their intricate structure, and bees carry the pollen from one flower to another. Darwin's interesting observations on this process have been recorded in great detail, and he and Asa Gray had an extensive correspondence upon the subject.

The plant has a wide range, extending in one form or another from Pennsylvania to Newfoundland, New Mexico, California, and Alaska. Perhaps more than one species is included in this citation of range, as those from the east and from the west look rather dissimilar.

The flowers sketched were obtained in the Siffleur River Valley, fifty miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.

"YELLOW PENTSTEMON

Pentstemon confertus Douglas

Yellow pentstemon is a graceful member of the Figwort Family. In congenial surroundings it is very plentiful, although inconspicuous on account of the pale coloring of its flowers, which are grouped in several whorls along the stem. Altitude affects the plant greatly; in the lower valleys it may grow to a height of two feet, but at a high elevation the stem is only a few inches tall. Yellow flowers are rare among the pentstemons, which are represented in the Rocky Mountains by a number of species, most of them with white or purple blossoms.

This pentstemon extends from Wyoming to California, and northward to Alberta and British Columbia.

The plant sketched grew in the valley of Cataract Creek near Hector, British Columbia, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"CAMAS

Quamasia quamash (Pursh) Coville

Camas is a relative of the lilies and hyacinths. It grows in large quantities in open meadows or boggy fields. When in bloom in early spring a camas meadow appears at a distance like a blue lake. The bulbs were used extensively as food by the northwestern Indians. When boiled they resemble potatoes in flavor. If baked over hot stones enclosed in a covering of grass for thirty-six hours they have a delicious chestnut flavor. Father de Smet in his “Oregon Missions” terms the bulb “the queen root of this clime.”

This lovely camas ranges from Utah, Montana, and northern California to British Columbia.

The sketch was made from plants growing at the east entrance to Glacier National Park, Montana.

"MOSS FORGET-ME-NOT

Eritrichum elongatum (Rydberg) W.F. Wight

This member of the Borage Family, whose flowers look so much like a true forget-me-not, is one of the plants that have adapted themselves to severe alpine conditions. Growing above timberline where there is little shelter from storm and wind, it hugs the ground, its woody root firmly inserted in some crevice, where barely sufficient soil has collected to permit its growth. Its flowers nestle in a mass of gray moss-like leaves, whose somber coloring enhances the rare blue of the flowers.

Moss forget-me-not ranges through the Rocky Mountains from New Mexico to Montana and Oregon.

The specimen painted was found on a trail that carried us away from the lower valleys near Apollonaris Spring in Yellowstone National Park, Montana.

"WESTERN PIPSISSEWA

Chimaphila umbellata var. occidentalis (Rydberg) Blake

Pipsissewa is a shy plant retiring to moss-covered banks in cold dark woods. Its delightful odor calls attention to its presence and its glossy evergreen leaves and dainty pink flowers are soon discovered. After the flowers have withered, the brown seed pods remain sometimes throughout the winter scattering the seeds to the wind. Pipsissewa belongs to the Pyrola group of the Heath Family, and is called sometimes prince's pine.

Western pipsissewa is distributed from New Mexico to Montana, California, and Alaska. Its eastern relative is the typical form of the species and is widespread in the northeastern United States and Canada.

The plant sketched grew on the shore of Emerald Lake, near Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"RED COMANDRA

Comandra livida Richardson

Red comandra belongs to the Sandalwood Family, which has few representatives in this country, most of its members being shrubs and trees of the tropics. It is parasitic on the roots of other plants, and it withers immediately when gathered. The light green flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the fruits, when they mature in mid-summer, are of a vivid striking red. Two other comandras with greenish or yellowish fruits are widely distributed in the United States.

This species of comandra has a wide range, occurring from the mountains of Vermont to Labrador, and across Canada to British Columbia and even Alaska.

We gathered the plant near Glacier Lake on the headwaters of the Saskatchewan River, fifty miles north of Lake Louise at an altitude of 6,000 feet, where this sketch was made.

"PALE STRAWBERRY

Fragaria glauca (Watson) Rydberg

Wild strawberries grow almost everywhere in the Canadian Rockies. Their large white flowers with yellow centers and the bright red fruits which follow them are known to all campers. Later in the season the leaves turn red. The plants propagate by runners, produced after the fruiting season. A tea made from the leaves is most efficacious in intestinal complaints, and its properties were known to the Indians, who often chewed the leaves for the same purpose. Wild strawberries are found throughout most of the United States and Canada, and also extend far southward along the mountains of Mexico. Long ago they were brought into cultivation, and they have been improved greatly, at least in size, by horticulturists.

This member of the Rose Family ranges from Nevada, New Mexico, and South Dakota to British Columbia.

The sketch was made from a specimen collected in the valley of Baker Creek, thirty miles by trail from Lake Louise, at an altitude of 600 feet.

"REDSTEM SAXIFRAGE

Saxifraga lyallii Engler

When traveling over the higher mountain regions above timberline, we frequently found the sloping banks of the tiny valleys spread with carpets of redstem saxifrage. Where the soil was wet by drippings from snowbanks, the tiny red and white flowers, carried well above the tufts of leaves on their red stems, reached their greatest perfection. When clumps of patnassia are associated with them, the effect is beautiful indeed.

Redstem saxifrage is a plant of narrow range, being found only from Montana and Alberta to British Columbia and Alaska.

The flowers sketched were obtained near Baker Lake, fifteen miles by trail from Lake Louise, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

"YELLOW DRYAD

Dryas drummondii Richardson

As yellow dryad is usually seen by mountain visitors, its mats of crinkled leaves are surmounted by fluffy seed heads, for the flowers open early and last for only a brief season. The plant grows most profusely in gravelly glacial stream bottoms, in limestone soil. Here it abounds until overwhelmed in midsummer by the high waters of melting glacial ice, surviving only on portions of the stream banks left undisturbed by the rushing water. The pale yellow flower always turns its face downward, and does not open fully to the sunlight. The dryads belong to the Rose Family.

This species is found often at high elevations, from Quebec to Montana, British Columbia, and Alaska.

The specimen sketched was procured in the Ice River Valley, twenty-five miles by trail from Leanchoil Station on the Canadian Pacific Railroad, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"YELLOW DRYAD

Dryas drummondii Richardson

When the flowers of yellow dryad are past, their stalks lengthen and soon the twisted seed heads develop into balls of fluff. These are borne on dainty stems about six inches above the close mats of gray-green leaves. Near Glacier Lake they grew in fairy rings. The soft pink fluffy fruits were very beautiful. The horses considered them only from the practical standpoint, and enjoyed eating them.

This member of the Rose Family is found in the mountains from Quebec to Montana, British Columbia and Alaska.

In the valley of the Siffleur River, fifty miles north of Lake Louise, by trail, the plant grew in abundance, and here we obtained these specimens at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"HELIOTROPE VALERIAN

Valeriana sitchensis Bongard

Heliotrope valerian grows plentifully in moist upland meadows, or on open mountain slopes, its tall succulent stems lifting the heads of white or pinkish flowers well above the surrounding vegetation. The flowers are very sweet-scented with a fragrance suggesting heliotrope and attract numerous small insects. If they are gathered and placed in water, however, the penetrating odor so characteristic of the Valerian Family becomes clearly noticeable and the water turns pink. The odor of the roots persists long after they are dry. Numerous species of valerian grow in the United States, especially in the West.

Heliotrope valerian is found from Montana and Oregon north to Yukon and Alaska.

The flowers sketched were obtained near Hector, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"MOSS CAMPION

Silene acaulis Linnaeus

Moss campion is one of the most attractive of the alpine plants and one frequently seen by the mountaineer climbing above timberline. Although its blooming season is short, differences in altitude and exposure in its many habitats are responsible for its blooming during a longer period than most alpine plants. It grows from a single woody root anchored deep in rocky soil, and spreads into a flat cushion often a foot or more in diameter. The bright green of the narrow leaves is beautifully contrasted with the pink, or rarely white, flowers, and the plant is always a joy to behold.

This lovely member of the Pink Family is found in arctic or arctic-alpine situations, from New Hampshire to Greenland, across Canada and from the highest mountains of New Mexico to Alaska; also in Europe and Asia.

The plant sketched was procured near Baker Lake, fifteen miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.

"ALPINE HAREBELL

Campanula lasiocarpa Chamisso

In the southern part of its range, alpine harebell is a comparatively rare plant and is to be found only by those hardy souls who climb to the heights. Here above timberline we found it hiding among the short grasses, as though to gain a little shelter from winds and storms. It was a thrilling experience to come upon so shy and rare a flower.

This attractive little harebell has a northern range, occurring in Alberta, British Columbia, and Alaska. It is found also in Siberia and Japan.

The sketch was made from a flower obtained on Eagle Peak, near Glacier, British Columbia, at an altitude of 8,000 feet.

Campanula rotundifolia Linnaeus

No one who has seen harebells remains unappreciative of their dainty beauty. The apparently delicate stems are really strong and well able to support the flowers they carry.

"RED WILLOW WEED

Epilobium latifolium Linnaeus

Red willowweed is a superb member of the Evening-primrose Family that prefers gravelly stream bottoms, especially those overflowed by the water from melting glaciers, and also often borders alpine brooks. The large petals are inserted at the top of the long slender pods, which, when ripe, split lengthwise, freeing the plumed seeds which are blown by the wind far from the parent plant. When the plants are in bloom, they make a gorgeous sight, often covering many acres with their lovely color.

This plant has a wide range from Greenland to Quebec, South Dakota, Colorado, Washington, and Alaska. It occurs also in Europe and Asia.

The sketch was made from a specimen obtained near Glacier, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"NORTHERN ANEMONE

Anemone parviflora Michaux

On account of its greater range in altitude, northern anemone flowers during a longer season than most of its relatives. If we climb in midsummer above timberline, we find it in sheltered places where the snow has recently melted, blooming beside the rivulets of snow water. It is able to withstand even the frosty nights of the higher slopes and appears none the worse for the freezing it has experienced. When the flowers are past, a woolly seed head soon develops, and in autumn the seeds are carried away by the wind to new localities. The name Anemone is derived from a Greek word meaning “the wind.” Northern anemone belongs to the Buttercup Family, and has a wide range from Ontario to Labrador, Colorado, and Alaska. It grows also in Asia.

The flowers sketched were found near Wild Flower Camp, twenty-five miles by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

"ALBERTA PAINTBRUSH

Castilleja miniata Bentham

No group of plants that we have observed in the Canadian Rockies exhibits such a wonderful variety of color as the species of Castilleja, almost universally known as paintbrushes, which are representatives of the Figwort Family. All tints from white, through yellow, green, pink, red, and wine color, with every degree of shade between, are to be seen in nature's gardens. Some are dazzlingly brilliant, but others are softly shaded with the deepest color on the tips of the bracts forming the head. Even in the same species there is often a surprising variation in coloring, and isolated plants of forms with normally red bracts have yellow bracted spikes.

This species of paintbrush ranges from Montana and Washington north to Alberta and Saskatchewan.

The specimen painted grew near our camp on the headwaters of the Clearwater River, forty-five miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

"ELEPHANTHEAD

Pedicularis groenlandica Retz

Elephanthead loves wet meadows and the borders of lakes and streams. It prefers the region about timberline, and in sedgy upland swampy places it supplies masses of rich color. Flowers, stems, and leaves are often of almost the same tone. The curious flower resembles an elephant’s head with the trunk raised.

This plant and a similar one growing in California have been referred by a few botanists to a distinct genus, appropriately named Elephantella, but the two species agree essentially in their flower structure with other members of the genus Pedicularis.

This representative member of the Figwort Family is found in Greenland and Labrador, and from the mountains of New Mexico and California northward to Alaska.

It grew in many places in the Ptarmigan Valley, fifteen miles by trail north from Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,000 feet, where this specimen was obtained.

"LEWIS MONKEY FLOWER

Mimulus lewisii Pursh

In the neighborhood of Glacier, British Columbia, where I first saw this striking monkeyflower, it grew luxuriantly. Along the streams about timberline it found the habitat most suited to it, for although it never grew in water, it needed the cool drippings from melting snows higher up the slopes to sustain its lush growth. The large richly colored flowers were in pleasing contrast with the green leaves. I never found the plant in the Rockies east of the Columbia River. The specific name was given in honor of Meriwether Lewis of the celebrated Lewis and Clark Expedition to the Northwest. Although dissimilar in aspect, the monkeyflowers belong to the same family as the elephanthead, shown in the preceding plate—namely, the Figwort family.

Lewis monkeyflower is found from Colorado to Arizona, California, and British Columbia and locally eastward to Minnesota.

These specimens were gathered at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"ALPINE MONKEYFLOWER

Mimulus caespitosus Greene

The low growth of alpine monkeyflower coupled with the unusually large blossoms makes this species easy to recognize. It loves wet places by the edges of cold brooks, although it does not grow actually in the water. Often it is the first flower to gain a foothold in the beds of glacial moraines, uncovered by the recent recession of the ice. The masses of golden yellow flowers were conspicuous near the forefoot of the Ilecillewaet Glacier, near Glacier, British Columbia. The alpine monkeyflower belongs to the Figwort Family and ranges from Idaho to California and northward to British Columbia.

The flowers painted were gathered in the Asulkan Valley near Glacier, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

"ALEUTIAN FLEABANE

Erigeron unalaschensis (De Candolle) Rydberg

The alpine valleys of the Canadian Rocky Mountains are wonderful places in which to find wild flowers that flourish in high altitudes. Among these, the Aleutian fleabane, a member of the great Aster Family, deserves a prominent place. It delights in the moist earth near snow-water streams, being able to withstand the violent, almost daily changes from warm sunshine to freezing temperatures. The dainty plant often has a woolly covering to protect it.

This fleabane is found from Montana to Alaska as well as in Labrador and Greenland.

The specimens sketched were gathered in the Little Yoho Valley, fifteen miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.

"WHITEBARK PINE

Pinus albicaulis Engelmann

Whitebark pine, if growing in a favorable location, is somewhat different in its habit of growth from most other pine trees. The branches are flexible and often almost erect, the purple cones being borne near their ends. The trunk is frequently two to four feet in diameter, but the height of the tree is only twenty to thirty feet. This pine is seldom found below 5,000 feet, and at timberline it grows as a low and often creeping shrub. When in bloom the dainty pink staminate flowers are very lovely. They shed their pollen freely. On wind-swept summits this tree takes on weatherbeaten and fantastic forms.

Whitebark pine ranges from Wyoming to California and north to Alberta and British Columbia.

The branch sketched came from a tree which grew on the side of the Yoho Valley, ten miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

Picea engelmanni (Parry) Engelmann

Engelmann spruce is a majestic tree, sometimes growing to a height of a hundred and fifty feet with a trunk four or five feet in diameter. Its branches are produced in regular whorls. When growing with sufficient space around it, it is a handsome pyramidal tree, and in favorable seasons the top is adorned with masses of rich brown cones.

From Arizona and New Mexico northward to Alberta, British Columbia, and Yukon is the range of Engelmann spruce.

"CREEPING JUNIPER

Juniperus horizontalis Moench

The shores of the Saskatchewan River, Alberta, are often sandy, and along them we found many shrubs of creeping juniper with quantities of blue berries adorning their branches. The plant flourished in spite of the blowing sands, which in these places discourage all but the hardiest vegetation. Creeping juniper is similar in foliage to the familiar red cedar of the East, but in habit it is very different, growing usually as a dense mat, flat upon the ground.

Creeping juniper has a wide range from northern New York, Maine, and Nova Scotia to Minnesota, Wyoming, Alberta, and British Columbia.

"DRUMMOND WILLOW

Salix drummondiana Battratt

In the Canadian Rockies, as late summer arrives, this willow is clothed in its most beautiful garb. Each branch is adorned with loose masses of fluffy cotton, consisting of the seeds and the adhering plumes. These masses are blown far and wide by the wind, and if the plants happen to grow near streams, a windrow of cotton often accumulates along their moist margins. Later this is caught by the water and carried far downstream.

Drummond willow has a narrow range, being confined to Alberta and British Columbia.

The sketch was made from a specimen that grew at Sheep Creek, seventy-five miles by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"LYALL LARCH

Larix lyalli Parlatore

Of all the trees in the Canadian Rockies, Lyall larch is the most interesting and the most picturesque. It is usually found between 6,000 and 8,000 feet elevation, where its bright green foliage is easily recognized from a distance, skirting the darker green spruces and firs at timberline. A rugged tree, gnarled and twisted by the wind into picturesque forms, it reaches a height of fifty feet in favorable localities, with a trunk diameter of twenty inches. The cones are produced about once in three years. The wood is tough and hard to cut, but it makes a very hot although not lasting fire. As soon as a hard frost comes, the leaves turn bright yellow and soon fall. Doctor Charles S. Sargent and William M. Canby journeyed all the way from Boston in 1898 to find this tree in fruit. I had been stopping at Lake Louise and had procured a number of branches of Lyall larch with beautiful cones, from the shores of Lake Agnes. On arriving at Banff, I left my precious specimens on the rack beside the dining room door, while I got my supper. When the meal was finished, the bunch of larch had disappeared. On investigation, I found the two botanists sitting on the floor, with the Lyall larch between them, filled with enthusiasm that their long journey would be a fruitful one.

Lyall larch has a very narrow range. It grows in a few places in Montana and in northern Oregon, but is plentiful only in Alberta and British Columbia.

The branch sketched came from near Lake McArthur, twelve miles by trail from Hector, British Columbia, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.

"CROW BERRY

Empetrum nigrum Linnaeus

Crowberry grows as a dense matted shrub in rocky or shady places, frequently in company with Rocky Mountain cassiope. It is easy to confuse it with the latter plant if the two are not examined closely. The flowers are inconspicuous but the black berries are distinctive. The berries are much eaten by Arctic birds, although rather insipid to the human taste. This primitive plant is believed by some botanists to represent a survival, from some past geologic period, of a group ancestral to the present-day Heath Family. The Crowberry Family, as it is called, has few living members and most of these occupy isolated areas, widely scattered over the earth, evidently relics of a former much greater abundance.

This species is the most widespread member of the family, ranging from northern New York, Maine, and Greenland westward to Michigan and California, and northward to Alaska. It occurs also in Asia and Europe.

We gathered these specimens at Marble Canyon not far from the summit of Vermilion Pass, sixteen miles from Castle Station, Alberta, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

"SIBERIAN ONION

Allium sibericum Linnaeus

Siberian onion is seen frequently in the higher valleys in the Canadian Rockies. When growing in rich soil with an abundant supply of moisture, it is a showy plant. It occurs singly or in clumps, and is easily identified by its odor, which is similar to that of the garden chive, but more intense. It may be used for flavoring stews and soups, although with caution because its flavor is very strong. The flowers resemble tiny lilies, and as a matter of fact, the plant is a member of the Lily Family.

This species of onion has a wide range, from northern New York to Maine, and westward to Wyoming, Oregon, and Alaska. It is found also in Europe and Asia.

The brilliant color of slim larkspurs in mountain meadows filled us with delight, and when they were in company with Alberta paintbrush, forget-me-not, and heliotrope valerian, all in full bloom, we were able to appreciate the full beauty of nature's garden. In some places slim larkspur occurred in pure stands so that the meadows were blue with them. They are poisonous to cattle, which eat the young shoots in early spring, and the districts where they grow cannot be used for pasture. The name Delphinium was given to this genus of plants from a fancied resemblance of the flower to a dolphin. The larkspurs belong to the Buttercup Family.

Slim larkspur ranges from Montana to California and Oregon and northward to Alberta.

The plants sketched were obtained near Wild Flower Camp, twenty-five miles by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

"ARROWLEAF GROUNDSEL

Senecio triangularis Hooker

Arrowleaf groundsel is a common plant which blooms late in the season in the Canadian Rockies. It likes the rich soil of the borders of alder thickets, where the brittle stems are somewhat protected from the wind, and other moist places. It is a lush, coarse plant whose yellow flower heads give a gay color note in contrast to the bright green leaves.

The genus Senecio belongs to the Aster Family, and comprises at least twelve hundred species found in many parts of the world. They are widely distributed over the North American continent. This species ranges from New Mexico and California north to Saskatchewan and Alaska.

We gathered the specimen sketched near Evelyn Glacier, twenty-five miles from Castle, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.

"WRIGHT PENTSTEMON

Pentstemon wrightii Hooker

By the side of the winding road leading up the dry slopes of Tumamoc Hill to the Desert Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution, near Tucson, Arizona, I found great clumps of this beautiful pentstemon. The stems supporting the graceful flower panicles were two and a half feet high. The lovely color of the blossoms was a delight to all who passed. The plants grew out of the disintegrated rock of the mountain and subsisted with so little soil that it seemed all but impossible for them to flourish in such perfection in such an arid spot.

The pentstemons are named from the fact that in addition to their four normal stamens, they have a fifth sterile stamen which often is conspicuous because it is covered with hairs, and often extends well up toward the mouth of the corolla. The pentstemons belong to the Figwort Family.

"WHITE DAWNROSE

Pachyloplus marginatus (Nuttall) Rydberg

In the morning the dry sandy plains or mesas about Tucson are dotted with the beautiful white flowers of the dawnrose. About noon the blossoms close, and, turning pink in fading, they soon disappear, a new bud opening next morning. The petals are so ethereal in their delicate loveliness that it is hard to understand how they can spring from such an unfriendly dry soil.

White dawnrose ranges from Colorado, Utah, and Arizona to Idaho and Oregon.

The specimens sketched were gathered about forty miles south of Tucson, Arizona.

"EVENING-PRIMROSE

Pachyloplus hirsutus Rydberg

When traveling along the highway toward the Roosevelt Dam in Arizona I saw a plant about eighteen inches tall growing from a crevice in the rocks. It was full of buds as well as withered flowers, rising among masses of long green leaves. When the plant was lifted it was carried for several days awaiting an opportunity to sketch it. One evening on returning to the hotel for dinner, I noticed, on entering the room, a delightful odor like that of a night-blooming cereus, and the plant was discovered in full bloom. The sketch fortunately was made that evening, by electric light, for the next morning all the flowers had withered.

This species of evening-primrose ranges from Arizona and New Mexico to Wyoming.

"CLUSTERLILY

Hookera pauciflora (Torrey) Tidestrom

The Desert Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington is located near Tucson, Arizona, high up on a small desert mountain notable for its profusion of cactuses and other strange plants which are able to exist with a minimum of water. Among the sun-baked rocks grow many clusterlilies, which are always attractive in their dainty beauty. Their bulbs, sunk deep in soil, enable the plant to live from one blooming season to another.

The genus of the Lily Family to which clusterlily belongs contains many species restricted to Western North America, and occurring mainly in California, but the present species grows in Arizona and New Mexico.

The technical name of this genus was given in honor of Sir William Jackson Hooker, one of the most eminent of English botanists.

"CALIFORNIA PITCHERPLANT

Chrysamphora californica (Torrey) Greene

California pitcherplant is the only member of the Pitcherplant Family growing west of the Mississippi Valley. It is quite as curious a plant as its eastern relatives, the Sarracenias. The pitcher, often two feet tall, has leafy appendages growing from its mouth, the whole suggesting the head of a cobra. These appendages are somewhat trough-like, and insects traveling along them to collect the nectar secreted there are unsuspectingly led to the brink of the hollow leaves. Many of these fall in and are digested, contributing to the nourishment of the plant. The flower presents an almost equally strange appearance.

The plants grow in abundance in their favorite localities, the bogs of northern California, where this specimen was obtained, and adjacent Oregon.

"SCARLET MARIPOSA

Calochortus kennedyz Porter

Scarlet mariposa is one of the most brilliant representatives of the genus Calochortus. Its vivid color is accentuated by the contrasting dark purple gland on the lower part of each petal. These mariposas, of which there are many species, are greatly diversified as to the shape and color of their flowers, and are very abundant in the foothills and on the mountain slopes of Arizona and California. Some of them extend far southward into the mountains of Central Mexico. The genus is one of the most characteristic western American representatives of the Lily Family.

This species has a rather narrow range in Nevada, Arizona, and southern California.

"BUSHPOPPY

Dendromecon rigidum Bentham

The profuse bright yellow flowers of bushpoppy give the shrub a striking appearance. It grows from two to eight feet high, and blooms almost throughout the year. The leaves are willow-like and leathery in texture, and the main stems are rich brown in color.

This member of the Poppy Family has a restricted range in southern California and northern lower California.

"MEXICAN POPPY

Eschscholtzia mexicana Greene

Mexican poppy is a gay member of the Poppy Family, covering sandy desert mesas with sheets of lovely flowers. It is rather lower in growth than the California poppy. The finely cut gray-green leaves make an effective background for the flowers, which open fully in bright sunshine, but close at night and do not open in cloudy weather. The buds are enclosed by the sepals which form a tiny cap, which is pushed aside as the petals unfold. The plant is cultivated easily and is a great favorite with the amateur gardener.

Mexican poppy occurs in arid portions of Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and northern Mexico.

The sketch was made from specimens growing near Tucson, Arizona.

"FIRE PENTSTEMON

Pentstemon eatontz Gray

The thrifty clumps of fire pentstemon growing in perfection among the rocks or pendent from the sides of a canyon wall are strikingly handsome. They seem to delight in the most inaccessible places, and thrive in the scantiest pocket of soil, their flexible stems, two to three feet long, waving in the wind. This plant is one of the showiest members of the Figwort Family.

Fire pentstemon has a comparatively narrow range in Arizona, Utah, and Nevada.

The specimens grew near Superior, Arizona.

"CARDINAL MONKEYFLOWER

Mimulus cardinalis Douglas

If fortune favors, and you visit the Grand Canyon at the proper season of the year, you will find the brilliant cardinal monkeyflower in full glory at the Indian Gardens. Following down Bright Angel Trail with its many switchbacks and majestic panoramas of the canyon walls, you come to this comparatively level oasis, where a stream flows from a kindly spring. Here one can appreciate what water means to a dry country. Luxuriant trees and flowers hug the borders of the stream, and the eye can follow its course by the green fringe until the last trickle of water disappears in the ground. The cardinal monkeyflower, a representative of the Figwort Family, is attractive not only on account of the brilliant color of the blossoms, but also because of the lush growth of rich green leaves and stems that form a fitting background for the flowers.

Its range is from Mexico to western New Mexico and California, and northward to Oregon.

The plant painted was obtained near the spring mentioned above, in the Grand Canyon, Arizona.

"OCOTILLO

Fouquieria splendens Engelmann

In crossing the desert by train over the southern route to California, none of the new and curious plants observed is stranger than the ocotillo. A number of slender rod-like stems eight or ten feet long spring from a single root, rigidly spreading outward and upward. They are dull greenish gray in color and are armed with strong sharp thorns half an inch long. When the rains come in spring, the bare stems show signs of life, small green leaves appearing along them, while a mass of buds develops on a short stem at the end, spreading like a fish tail. Soon the buds open and the heavy bunches of flowers wave slowly back and forth in the desert wind. The Mexicans form paling fences about their dooryards by planting these stems close together in the ground and fastening them with wire. They sometimes take root and form a living fence, an effective barrier against most animals. This curious plant belongs to a small group known as the Ocotillo Family, which is nearly confined to the dry regions of Mexico.

Ocotillo has a wide range, from western Texas to southern California and over northern Mexico.

The specimen painted was obtained near Superior, Arizona.

"YUCCA

Yucca baileyi Wooton and Standley

The genus Yucca belongs to the Lily Family and contains many species native in North and Central America. The roots, when rubbed in water, give a thick suds, and they are often used as a substitute for soap in washing clothes, especially by the native people of the Southwest. The Amole, as the root is called by the Mexicans, is very efficacious in cleaning fabrics, or when used in bathing or as a shampoo, leaving the skin smooth and the hair soft and glossy. The names soap-root and Spanish dagger or Spanish bayonet are applied to the yuccas in the United States.

When driving in June from Gallup, New Mexico, to Zuni, I found this beautiful yucca coming into bloom in many places along the edge of the sparse pinyon or nut pine forests. The sturdy spikes of large, pale green flowers, tinged on the sepals with purple, grew from two to three feet in height. They rose from a bristling clump of relatively short, narrow, sharp-pointed green leaves, furnished along their borders with stiff, coarse, threadlike fibers.

This yucca, which was named for Vernon Bailey, of the U.S. Biological Survey, has a narrow range in northwestern New Mexico and northeastern Arizona.

"SCARLET GLOBE-MALLOW

Sphaeralcea grossulaviaefolia (Hooker and Arnott) Rydberg

Scarlet globe-mallow is one of the showy plants of the Arizona mesas and river valleys, where often it grows in great abundance. The flowers commonly are scarlet, but they are equally handsome when of a paler hue. They are produced in spikelike panicles on the upper part of stems so weak that they bend gracefully before the wind. By the Mexicans the plant is called malojo, ""eye-bane,"" because the small, branched, starlike hairs on the leaves and stems adhere to the fingers in handling, and if brushed into the eyes, cause irritation and pain.

This brilliant member of the Mallow Family is very common in Arizona, and ranges northward to Idaho and Wyoming.

The specimen sketched was gathered near the Desert Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution at Tucson, Arizona.

"QUILL-LEAF TILLANDSIA

Tillandsia fasciculata Swartz

In motoring from lower Virginia southward, the ever-increasing abundance of epiphytic plants is striking. In southern Virginia, Spanish moss frequently drapes the trees, especially the bald cypress. Farther down the coast, other species of the Pineapple Family make their appearance, and in Florida, a number of different kinds are native. In some of the hammocks there, all the branches of the trees and even the bark of the trunk, serve for the attachment of bromeliads, orchids, and ferns, and the epiphytic plants are represented by many different species. In such a hammock a short distance north of West Palm Beach, Florida, the specimen here illustrated was obtained.

The tillandsia usually dies after flowering, but its minute seeds, with their tufts of silky hairs, are scattered by the winds. The leaves of these plants are dilated at the base, thus forming a series of pockets which catch and hold water. Vegetable debris, as well as atmospheric dust, falls into the water and the plant absorbs the products of its decay, thus obtaining much of its nourishment.

Quill-leaf tillandsia ranges from southern Florida south through the West Indies, and is widely distributed in other parts of tropical America.

"CATESBY PITCHERPLANT

Sarracenia catesbaei Elliott

This pitcherplant was discovered by Mark Catesby, who explored the Carolinas in 1722, and was later named in his honor by Stephen Elliott, in his ""Sketch of the Botany of South-Carolina and Georgia."" There is a difference of opinion among present-day botanists as to its status, some agreeing with Elliott that it is a distinct species, while others hold it to be a hybrid between Sarracenia flava and S. purpurea. It does combine the characters of the two presumptive parents in a striking way,—in the shape and position of the leaves, in the size of the flower parts, and especially in the petal color, which exhibits an attractive mingling of the yellow of the one species with the maroon of the other.

Catesby pitcherplant is reported to occur from Florida to North Carolina, although always rare and local. The specimen painted was grown in the Department of Agriculture greenhouses by Dr. Frederick V. Coville, the root having been collected by Dr. Edgar T. Wherry in a swamp near Quincy, Florida, in 1925. Dr. Wherry states that this plant grew in association with the two species of which it is supposed to be a cross, but that the adult clump was surrounded by seedlings in such a manner as to indicate that it is capable of reproducing itself, and is, accordingly, on the way to becoming an independent species.
