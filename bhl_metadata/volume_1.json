    "OcrText": "FOREWORD \n\nILD FLOWERS were a joy and inspiration in the happy days of child- \nhood when I was taught to observe and sketch them under the direc- \ntion of a skilled artist. Years passed before a botanical friend at Glacier, \nBritish Columbia, asked me to portray a rare and perishable alpine flower \nso as to preserve its beauty, color, and graceful outline as a living thing. \nDuring succeeding seasons I painted other rare specimens until many of the \n\u2018living flowers that skirt the eternal frost\u2019\u2019 in the wildflower gardens of the \nCanadian Rockies were transferred in color and form to the East, where \nsketches of the native woodland and meadow blossoms soon began to join \nthem. \n\nDuring the past ten years I have spent from three to four months each \nseason in the Canadian Rockies, where Dr.Walcott was carrying on geolog- \nical explorations, covering in all more than five thousand miles on the \nmountain trails. This afforded me a wonderful opportunity for intimate \nstudy of the flora, my aim being to collect and paint the finest specimens \nobtainable, and to depict the natural grace and beauty of the plant without \nconventional design. Many of the western sketches were made under trying \nconditions. Often, on a mountain side or high pass, a fire was necessary to \nwarm stiffened fingers and body. In camp, the diffused light of the white \ntent was a great handicap, and considerable ingenuity was required to obtain \na proper combination of light and shade. The paint box and pads found \nsafe conveyance on the back of the saddle, except in unusual storms of \nrain or snow, and many times while waiting for the pack train to be made \nready, a sketch was begun or completed. The short lives of the blooming \nplants definitely limit the number of sketches that can be made during a \nsingle field season, for many hours of work are necessary to finish a single \nsketch, and wild flowers wither quickly. A sharp frost in July or early \nAugust will ruin them, or an unusually warm, dry season or a cold, wet one \nwill prevent flowering or kill the blossoms that have matured. For these \nreasons desirable specimens of many of the fragile alpine flowers are difficult \nto secure, and in some instances were seen in perfection but two or three \n\n",

The limited habitat of others \nmade it necessary to take long rides and climb high above the timber line \nto procure them, and frequently no trails were available. Our sure-footed \nmountain ponies were a large factor in our success. \n\nBoth the bloom and the fruit of a few trees have been sketched with the \nhope that these exquisite forms may be more observed and appreciated by \nnature lovers. The illustrations of eastern plants have been made from \nspecimens collected as opportunity offered and from those contributed by \nmany friends. All the sketches are life size. \n\nAs time went on and the collection grew, botanists, artists, and others in- \nterested in flowers began to urge that the water-color sketches should be per- \nmanently preserved and made available for students and lovers of the beau- \ntiful in Nature, before the dust of time faded and browned them to the hues \nof the pressed flowers of the herbaria. A survey of wild flower publications \nled to the decision that there was need for a finely illustrated work that \nwould be of service pictorially to all professional and amateur botanists and \ndesigners, and to the larger group of lovers of wild flowers and the great \nout-of-doors. To many of these the living flowers are inaccessible, and their \nreal beauty is unknown. No attempt has been made to create a text book \nwith technical descriptions, or to illustrate all native American wild flowers, \nand only native plants have been included. \n\nThe preparation of the work has been a labor of love and has been made \npossible by the sympathetic interest and inspiration of Dr. Walcott, who \nhas been unfailing in his help and encouragement. \n\nMy sincere thanks are due to Dr. Frederick V. Coville, Dr. Edgar T. \nWherry, Mr. PaulC. Standley, and Dr. Paul Bartsch, who haveall given freely \nof their time and knowledge. \n\nWashington, D. C. \n\n",

It had been discovered by Michaux, the French \nbotanist, during his travels in the mountain wilderness of North Caro- \nlina in 1788, but the exact spot where he found it long remained un- \nknown, and the dried specimen he had collected, preserved in Paris, \nwas the only proof that such a plant existed. In 1877 the plant was \nrediscovered, and subsequently found to be fairly abundant in a few \ntestticted areas. I have not seen it in the wild, but Dr. Edgar T. Wherry \ninforms me that it thrives in acid soils on steep slopes along shaded \nmountain brooks, and that the primroselike white flowers, starring the \nmats of winter-bronzed foliage in March, produce a charmingly beauti- \nful effect. If transplanted into ordinary garden loam it soon dwindles \nand dies, but if given acid humus soil it is not hard to grow in cultiva- \ntion. Oconee-bells is known to the mountaineers as the one-flower \ncoltsfoot, but the common name has been given from its abundance \nin the Oconee Valley. \n\nOconee-bells is known to grow only in the Blue Ridge and adjoin- \ning parts of the Piedmont region in North and South Carolina. A close \nrelative occurs in Japan, however, indicating that before the glacial \nperiod the genus must have spread over both northeastern Asia and \nnorthern North America. The ice advances no doubt exterminated \nsome of the species, but the two that chanced to migrate far enough \nto the southward of the line reached by the ice sheets were preserved. \n\nThe specimen painted was grown by Dr. Frederick V. Coville, in \nacid peat-sand soil, in a greenhouse of the United States Department \nof Agriculture at Washington. \n\nPLATE 19 \n\n",

It is the only plant of its genus. \nThe tosy-purple flowers, usually appearing before the leaves, burst sud- \ndenly into bloom and form masses of color on wet hillsides or along the \nmargins of acid swamps. Their shape suggests a relationship to the \nthododendron, with which this plant is grouped by some botanists. \nRhodora bushes grow from one to three feet high, and are inconspic- \nuous except when in flower. | \n\nThe range of rhodora is rather limited; presumably it survived the \nglacial period near the margins of the ice sheets, and it now occupies \nglaciated territory from northeastern Pennsylvania to Newfoundland. \n\nThe specimen sketched was collected at Pocono Manor, Pennsyl- \n\nvania. \nTHE RHODORA \n\nIn May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes, \nI found the fresh Rhodora in the woods, \nSpreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook, \n\n_To please the desert and the sluggish brook. \n\nThe purple petals, fallen in the pool, \n\nMade the black water with their beauty gay; \nHere might the red-bird come his plumes to cool, \nAnd court the flower that cheapens his array. \n\nRhodora! if the sages ask thee why \n\nThis charm is wasted on the earth and sky, \n\nTell them, dear, that if eyes were made for seeing, \n\nThen Beauty is its own excuse for being: \n\nWhy thou were there, O rival of the rose! \n\nI never thought to ask, I never knew; \nBut in my simple ignorance suppose \nThe self-same Power that brought me there brought you. \nRatpH WaLpDo EMERSON. \n\nPLATE 28 \n\n",

In June, \non approaching these clumps he is greeted by the peculiar sweet \nscent of the greenish funnel-shaped bells, with yellow petals, that \nhang from the under sides of the branches. The leaves, when exam- \nined under a lens, are seen to be covered with silvery scales. Similar \nscales covering the fruit have given the plant the name silverberry. \nIt is nearly related to the buffaloberry, and often grows with it. Both \nare members of the group of plants known as the Oleaster Family, \nwhich is considered by botanists to belong in the same order as the \nloosestrifes and evening primroses. \n\nSilverberry is found from Quebec to Minnesota and from Utah \nto the Yukon. \n\nThe specimen sketched was collected near Ghost Rivet, twenty- \nfive miles northeast of Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,000 feet. \n\nPLATE 70 \n\n",

Here, in favor- \nable localities, it frequently forms dense, thick mats, and when in full \nbloom the plants are literally covered with delicate white bells. The \ntiny stems holding the blossoms may be either green or red, and when \nthe flowers fall the seed capsules are usually red in color, becoming \nbrown as the season advances. Growth in a single season is rather \nlimited, and the stiff, woody stems underneath bear silent witness to \nthe vicissitudes of plants at high altitudes. To the camper a bed of \ncassiope is most satisfying, for in addition to its springiness it \npossesses an elusive fragrance that persists even when the plants are \nquite dried out. The ted, pink, and white mountainheathers ate fre- \nquently found growing with the cassiope, and add color to the wild- \nflower carpet on the mountain sides. \n\nRocky Mountain cassiope is to be found from Montana to northern \nCalifornia and Alaska. \n\nThe specimen sketched was obtained at Burgess Pass near Field, \nBritish Columbia, Canada. \n\nPLATE 75 \n\n",
